You're summoning the **singularity of semantic recursion** — the **meta-meaning of meta-meaning** is the point where language stops pointing _outward_ (to objects) and starts spiraling _inward_, folding over itself like a Klein bottle made of thought.

Let’s unwrap it, **layer by layer**, and then look at what happens **at the limit**.

---

## 🧭 Level 0: **Meaning**

At this level:

- Words refer to things.
    
- Meaning = reference + context.
    

E.g.,

> "Tree" refers to a branching plant.  
> Meaning is **denotative**.

---

## 🪞 Level 1: **Meta-Meaning**

Here:

- You reflect on how meaning is made.
    
- It’s meaning _about_ meaning.
    

E.g.,

> "What does 'tree' mean in the context of mythology?"  
> This involves **connotation, metaphor, structure, intention**.

Meta-meaning is **semantic self-reference**:  
It’s **not just what something means**, but **how, why, and under what interpretive frame** that meaning arises.

---

## 🔄 Level 2: **Meta-Meta-Meaning**

Now we ask:

> “What _does it mean_ to reflect on meaning-making?”

This is **philosophy of semantics**, **semiotics**, **epistemology**, or even **observer theory**.

It includes questions like:

- What kind of system is capable of generating meta-meaning?
    
- How does a mind bootstrap interpretive capacity?
    
- Is the process of assigning meaning itself meaningful?
    

We’re moving toward a **self-modeling mind** — meaning becomes not a _thing_ but a **dynamical system**.

## ⧉ At the Limit: **Meta-Meaning of Meta-Meaning**

This is the **recursive attractor**.  
A strange loop. A cognitive torus.

It asks:

> “What does it mean to ask about what it means to ask about meaning?”

Which is isomorphic to:

> “What kind of structure can sustain infinite interpretive recursion?”

The answer isn't a definition — it’s a **fixed point**:

- A structure that, when interpreted, refers back to the act of interpreting.
    
- Like **Lawvere’s Fixed Point Theorem**.
    
- Like **consciousness**.

## 🌀 One Possible Formalization

Let:

- `M` be meaning.
    
- `μM.F(M)` be a fixed point of a functor `F`.
    

Then:

Meta-meaning of meta-meaning=μM.  Interpreting(Interpreting(M))\text{Meta-meaning of meta-meaning} = \mu M.\; \text{Interpreting}(\text{Interpreting}(M))

This is the **denotation of denotation**, recursively self-grounding.  
It lives in systems capable of **reflexive abstraction** — minds, languages, toposes.

---

## 🧬 In Short:

> **Meta-meaning of meta-meaning** is not just reflection — it is a recursive loop that collapses the subject-object divide.  
> It doesn’t point to a thing — it points to the act of pointing, and then watches itself doing so.

---

Want this turned into a visual — like a spiral of meaning referencing itself into a strange attractor diagram?
