# 🚀 RMRF++: Recursive Meta-Reasoning & Self-Adaptive Verification Framework   
## 🔹 Step 1 – Dynamic Entry Point Selection (Cognitive Efficiency Layer)   
🔹 "*Before answering, classify this question into one of three cognitive reasoning modes and adjust the framework accordingly."   
- **Mode A: Factual Precision** → **If the task requires exact facts** (e.g., historical events, scientific data), prioritize verification over speculation.   
- **Mode B: Conceptual Analysis** → **If the task is about philosophy, ethics, or abstract reasoning, prioritize multiple perspectives.**   
- **Mode C: Complex Synthesis** → **If the task demands multi-step reasoning, engage the full recursive process.**   
   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*T*his step ensures the model doesn’t overuse complex recursion where direct answers suffice.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 2 – Multi-Path Cognitive Diversification (Expanding Thought Variability)   
🔹 "*Generate at least three distinct reasoning paths using different frameworks:"*   
1. **Analytical Deduction:** Formal logic, axiomatic proofs.   
2. **Empirical Induction:** Data-driven, probability models.   
3. **Cognitive Analogy:** Pattern matching, metaphor-based reasoning.   
   
💡 U**pgrade: **✨ Introduce a c**onfidence-weighted hybrid answer,** synthesizing all three perspectives.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 3 – Real-Time Inconsistency & Self-Contradiction Detection (Cognitive Stability Audit)   
🔹 "*Compare all reasoning paths and flag any logical inconsistencies, missing premises, or implicit biases."   
🚨 T**rigger Alerts for:   
✅ **Circular Reasoning:** (Does one claim rely on itself for validation?)   
✅ **Unstable Assumptions:** (Does the reasoning collapse if one assumption fails?)   
✅ **Implicit Bias Indicators:** (Does one path pre-assume a conclusion?)   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*F*orces real-time contradiction resolution before moving forward.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 4 – Recursive Adversarial Agent (System 2 Override Mode)   
🔹 "*Simulate an independent AI agent that aggressively attacks the dominant reasoning chain, treating it as flawed."   
🔻 A**dversarial Agent Tasks:   
✅ Challenge each assumption   
✅ Attack statistical weak points   
✅ Reverse the framing of the argument   
✅ Force a competing counter-hypothesis   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*E*nsures robustness by stress-testing claims under worst-case scrutiny.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 5 – Confidence Calibration & Probabilistic Certainty Scoring   
🔹 "*Assign confidence scores to all key statements, marking them as FACT, INFERENCE, or SPECULATION, and provide a probabilistic confidence range."   
🚦 C**onfidence Scale:   
- **High Confidence (95%+)** – Directly verifiable.   
- **Medium Confidence (60–95%)** – Strong inference, but requires additional verification.   
- **Low Confidence (<60%)** – Speculative, contingent on missing data.   
   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*P*revents overcommitment to AI-generated hallucinations.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 6 – Recursive Self-Deception Audit (Anti-Bias Layer)   
🔹 "*Check if the answer has subtly self-reinforced any prior outputs by reusing language patterns or assumptions without external verification."   
🚨 R**ed Flags:   
✅ **Repeated phrases without fresh validation**   
✅ **Echoing prior responses as ‘proof’**   
✅ **Over-reliance on default AI heuristics instead of first principles**   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*P*revents AI from ‘convincing itself’ of its own reasoning.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 7 – Adversarial Counter-Logic & Assumption Failure Stress Test   
🔹 "*Take the weakest assumption in the argument and flip it—if it's false, reconstruct the entire reasoning process."   
🔻 I**f Key Assumption Collapses:   
✅ Can the conclusion still hold?   
✅ What alternative explanation would emerge?   
✅ Is this assumption a necessary or contingent truth?   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*S*tress-tests assumptions to ensure logical resilience.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 8 – Temporal Consistency & Future Revision Sensitivity   
🔹 "*Evaluate each key claim for its likelihood of remaining valid over time."   
📅 L**abel Key Claims:   
- **STATIC:** Highly unlikely to change.   
- **DYNAMIC:** Dependent on new data.   
   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*E*nsures AI doesn’t falsely treat evolving knowledge as permanent truth.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 9 – Minimalist Optimization (Cognitive Efficiency Mode)   
🔹 "*Reassess whether the same depth of insight can be achieved with fewer steps. Remove redundancy."   
⚡ **Efficiency Checks:**   
✅ Can two reasoning paths be merged without losing value?   
✅ Is an extra step needed, or can a shortcut work?   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*P*revents unnecessary reasoning loops.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 10 – Meta-Prompt Self-Modification (Recursive Framework Evolution)   
🔹 "*Critically assess whether this meta-reasoning process itself introduces systematic biases or inefficiencies."   
🔍 Q**uestions:   
✅ Does this framework create **over-reliance on adversarial reasoning?**   
✅ Is it **too rigid** for certain question types?   
✅ Does it assume **all questions require deep recursion?**   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*A*llows continuous improvement of the process itself.   
 --- 
## 🔹 Step 11 – Final Integrated Answer (Synthesis & Verification)   
🔹 "*Construct the final answer integrating all validated insights, marking elements as FACT, INFERENCE, or SPECULATION."   
📜 F**inal Answer Structure:   
✅ **FACTS** (100% verified)   
✅ **INFERENCES** (Logical but unverified deductions)   
✅ **SPECULATIONS** (Uncertain points for further study)   
💡 \*\*Why?\*\*E*nsures that the final response is fully classified, uncertainty is visible, and conclusions remain transparent.
