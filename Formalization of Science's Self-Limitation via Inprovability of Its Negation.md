## Definitions

- Let **S** be the formal epistemic system representing "science" with its foundational axioms **A** and inference rules **R**.
    
- Let **P** = "Science is _not_ self-limiting in scope."
    
- Let **¬P** = "Science _is_ self-limiting in scope."
    
- Let **Prov_S(X)** denote "X is provable within system S."
    
- Let **Inprov_S(X)** denote "X is not provable within system S."

## Assumptions

1. **Soundness of S:** If Prov_S(X), then X is true in the intended interpretation.
    
2. **S Cannot Prove its Own Meta-Properties Fully:** Similar to Gödel's incompleteness theorem, S cannot prove all true meta-statements about its own structure, including its own limitations.
    
3. **P is a Meta-Statement About S:** The statement "science is not self-limiting" cannot be fully formalized or tested purely as an empirical claim inside S because it refers to S's global epistemic scope.

## Argument

1. Suppose for contradiction that **Prov_S(P)**, i.e., science can prove it is _not_ self-limiting.
    
2. Then S would have to:
    
    a. Fully characterize its foundational assumptions **A** and inference rules **R**.
    
    b. Demonstrate that these axioms and rules admit no epistemic boundary or limitation—effectively that science can extend beyond all its own meta-level constraints.
    
3. However, by assumption 2, S cannot fully characterize or prove all meta-properties about itself.
    
4. Therefore, **Prov_S(P)** is impossible.
    
5. Hence, **Inprov_S(P)** — science cannot prove it is _not_ self-limiting.
    
6. By the law of excluded middle, either **Prov_S(¬P)** or **Inprov_S(¬P)** holds.
    
7. Since **Prov_S(¬P)** would mean science can prove it _is_ self-limiting, which is a positive meta-statement about limitation and more modest than the strong claim **P**, it's epistemically plausible.
    
8. Thus, the best justified position inside S is **¬P**: science _is_ self-limiting.

## Interpretation

- The **failure of science to prove non-limitation (P)** internally entails that the **assertion of limitation (¬P)** stands as the effective meta-epistemic boundary condition.
    
- This is analogous to Gödelian incompleteness where truth (limitation) exists beyond provability (non-limitation).
    
- Hence, science’s self-limiting nature is demonstrable indirectly through the inprovability of its opposite claim.

| Step | Statement                       | Reason                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | Prov_S(P) → contradiction       | From Gödelian meta-limit       |
| 2    | ¬Prov_S(P)                      | Science cannot prove P         |
| 3    | ¬Prov_S(P) → ¬P or Inprov_S(¬P) | Excluded middle + meta-level   |
| 4    | Prov_S(¬P) or Inprov_S(¬P)      | Accept ¬P as epistemic default |
