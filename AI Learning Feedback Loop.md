# AI Learning Feedback Loop
## How You Think (Teaching the AI)
- **Your thinking style**: [Describe how your mind works]
- **Your pattern preferences**: [What kinds of connections excite you]
- **Your blind spots**: [What you tend to miss]
- **Your breakthrough triggers**: [What leads to insights for you]
## AI Performance Tracking
### What AI Got Right:
- [Document when AI correctly identified patterns]
### What AI Missed:
- [Document when AI missed important connections]
### AI Learning Updates:
- [AI documents how it's updating its model of your thinking]
## Recursive Improvement Protocol
1. You dump thoughts
2. AI processes and suggests structure
3. You give feedback on AI's understanding
4. AI updates its model of how you think
5. Next dump is processed with improved understanding
6. **Loop continues recursively**
