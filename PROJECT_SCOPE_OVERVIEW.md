# Project Scope Overview

## Central Architecture & Knowledge Base
- **Meta-Recursive Core Strategy Index**: Defines the self-improving kernel, reflection layer, recursive task loop, modular intelligence, analytics, meta-learning, and drift detection. Interfaces and methods are cross-referenced for composability and feedback-driven evolution.
- **Meta-Recursive Semantic Engine**: Synthesizes symbolic seeds, semantic transformation, and meta-recursive evolution. Employs iterative prompt strategies, motif referencing, contradiction/drift auditing, and recursive documentation. Provides a Pythonic semantic object structure and guidance for agent collaboration.
- **Meta-Recursive Collapse Engine**: Centralizes operator stacks, strategic stabilizers, and collapse logic. Implements prime-modulated recursion, contradiction folding, echo stabilization, and entropy management. Cross-links with the master archive and core strategy files.
- **Grand Archive of Recursive Intelligence**: Documents foundational principles, patterns, methods, applications, and ongoing evolution. Surfaces strategies and architectural patterns from inner modules, serving as a living repository and catalyst for research.
- **AGI_Blueprint**: Outlines the theoretical and practical scope for recursive, memory-driven, and agentic architectures. Details core themes (recursion, memory, semantic reasoning, agentic frameworks, emergence), hierarchical outlines, key insights, and next steps for iterative refinement and integration.

## Key Resource Structure
- **Codex Anytype 0/1/2**: Rich markdown and reference files for recursive intelligence, prompt engineering, meta-recursive strategies, and system blueprints.
- **Book Library**: Extensive PDFs on recursion, memory, semantic logic, agentic frameworks, and emergent intelligence.
- **Supporting Modules**: JARVIS, betterpython-main, UltraSelfRecursive.ts, and YAML/TXT system prompts for operational and experimental modules.

## Recursive Intelligence System Implementation Plan
### Core Modules (Phase 1)
- **Recursive Feedback Engine**: Implements the core recursion, collapse, reflection, and echo tracking logic. Anchored in `agent_rebuilt.py` and guided by motifs from `meta-recursive-core-strategy-index.md` and `meta-recursive-collapse-engine-central.md`.
- **Self-Training Feedback Shell**: Feedback loop that reprocesses failed outputs, logs cycles, and extracts improvements. Integrates with the agent's memory kernel and drift/collapse detection subsystems.
- **Teaching Output Generator**: Module that auto-generates explanations and tutorials from internal recursion logs, enabling the system to teach its own process.
- **Collapsed Memory Tracker**: Tracks and logs how the system learns and evolves, supporting continuous improvement and meta-learning.

### Documentation & Reference Integration
- **Loaded Reference Documents**:
    - AI-Optimized Learning & Meta-Recursive Intelligence.md
    - Theory_Of_Everything_Grand_Unified_Theor.pdf
    - meta-recursive-core-strategy-index.md
    - meta-recursive-collapse-engine-central.md
    - Recursive Program Synthesis using Paramorphisms.pdf
    - Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration for LLMs via.pdf
    - AlphaEvolve.pdf
- **AGI_Blueprint.md**: To be expanded with explicit mapping of these modules, their interconnections, and references to the above documents.
- **PROJECT_SCOPE_OVERVIEW.md**: Now explicitly maps the recursive engine, feedback shell, teaching generator, and memory tracker as core deliverables, referencing the loaded PDFs and markdowns.

### Next Steps
- Refine the blueprint by extracting and summarizing critical PDFs and markdowns, especially on recursive agentic systems and prompt engineering.
- Expand sections with mechanisms, diagrams, and pseudocode, referencing Codex Anytype and resource summaries.
- Map interconnections between all themes and modules for a holistic AGI architecture.
- Prototype and document key recursive/agentic modules, ensuring theoretical and practical alignment.
- Establish a feedback loop for continuous integration of new insights and emergent patterns.

This overview reflects the current resource structure and synthesizes the project's recursive, semantic, and agentic foundations for ongoing development. It now explicitly encodes the recursive intelligence system's core modules, feedback shell, teaching generator, and memory tracker, ensuring alignment with the AGI blueprint and meta-recursive strategy documents.
