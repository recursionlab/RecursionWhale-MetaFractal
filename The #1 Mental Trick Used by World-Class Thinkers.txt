BRAIN GAMES

TAKING SIDES
Most people are either left- or right-handed,
but did you know that you can also have a
dominant foot and a preferred eye? In both
physical and mental tasks, the left and right
sides of your brain are far from equal, and it
is very rare for someone to be able to use both
hands or feet equally well. Try the following
tests to ﬁnd which side you are on
on.

Best foot forward
The easiest way of ﬁnding which
of your feet is dominant is to kicck
a soccer ball, but you usually ta
ake
the ﬁrst step of a ﬂight of stairss
with your stronger foot, too. You
ur
preferred foot may not be on
the same side as your dominan
nt
hand—you
y can be left-footed an
nd
right-handed or vice versa.

Eye-motion
Look straight at the nose of the girl in each of
these pictures. In which one do you think she looks
happier? Most people ﬁnd that she looks happier in
the bottom image, which shows her smiling on the
left side of the picture. This is because information
from your left visual ﬁeld gets processed in your
brain’s right hemisphere, which is also dominant
for interpreting emotions.

Eye see you

Trick your brain

To
o discove
er which is your dominant
eye, hold up your index ﬁnger
tto eye level and look past it
into the distance. Then close
ea
ach eye, one at a time. You
will see that with your weaker
eyye, your ﬁnger will appear
to ju
ump, whereas with your
stronger eye, it will stay in place.
Your sttronger eye ﬁgures out the
position
n of things, while the weaker
eye help
ps with depth perception.

This exercise reveals how your brain sometimes tricks you
into taking shortcuts. First, draw this upside-down picture of
a face. Then turn the face the right way up and draw it again.
When you compare the two pictures, you may be surprised
to ﬁnd that the upside-down version is the most accurate.

Handy test
Ambidexterity is the ability to use both hands equally well. To
see if you are ambidextrous try the exercise below. Take a pencil
in your right hand and ask a friend to time you for 15 seconds.
Starting top right, work your way along the line, putting as many
dots as you can in the white circles. Then do the same on the
other side with your left hand and compare the results.

The left side of your brain assigns simple shapes
to common objects—for example, an almond shape for
an eye. So if you draw a face the right way up, you
probably draw the features based on what you think they
look like rather than what you see. When you look
at a face upside down, however, the right side of your
brain works harder to understand the unfamiliar image
and you draw the shapes and lines you actually see.

Left hand
start
Right hand
start

You will get the farthest
along the line with your
dominant hand, but you may
surprise yourself by just how
well you did with your
weaker hand. If you found
that you got just as far
with each hand, you are
probably ambidextrous.

Determination
Born in Poland in 1867, Marie Curie was
determined to be a scientist, even though
such a career was not considered suitable
for a woman in the 1800s. She fought poverty
and prejudice to win two Nobel Prizes for
her pioneering work on radioactivity.

Some people just seem to be born geniuses.
Garry Kasparov was only 13 when he won the
Russian junior chess championship in 1976,
and he became the youngest-ever world
champion in 1985. He had a natural talent,
but he worked hard to make the most of it.

Encouragement

Broad view
Some geniuses do one thing extremely well,
but others excel at many things. Thomas
Jefferson—the main author of the U.S.
Declaration of Independence in 1776—was
a philosopher, archaeologist, architect, and
inventor, as well as a politician who became
president of the United States.

American sistterrs Venus and Serena
Williams are am
mong the greatest of all
tennis players. They showed amazing
talent from a young age, but they owe a
lot of their success to their
h i parents,
who coached and encouraged them to
build on their skills.

We are visual creatures. We identify most things by sight
and we think mainly in visual terms. So for most of us,
sight is our dominant sense. This means that a lot of
the information we commit to memory is in the form
of visual images. But how do the brain and eyes
work together to create these images?
wo
Pupil The opening

Image convertor
Your eye is a ball of transparent jelly lined with light-sensitive
cells. Light rays enter your eye through lenses that focus an
upside-down image on the cells. These cells respond by
generating tiny electrical signals that pass down a bundle
of nerve ﬁbers to your brain. The cells exposed to parts of
the image that are light generate bigger signals than cells
exposed to dark parts, just like the pixels in a digital camera
ra
sensor. The cells turn the image into an electronic code
that your brain can process.

This is because the sensory cells in
your eyes can adapt to the low light
level—but it takes time. If you turn
the light back on, you get dazzled
because your eyes have adapted
to the dark. They must readapt to
the light, but they do this much
more quickly.

Strange effects
Bright lights and contrasting patterns can cause strange
optical effects. For example, if you stare at something for
a minute and then close your eyes, you see a negative
afterimage. Each color is replaced by its opposite, so the
yellow and red ﬂowers shown below appear blue and cyan.
This is a side effect of the way your brain processes color.

Blind spot
The point where the optic nerve leaves the eye cannot
detect light, but your brain invents information to ﬁll the
gap. You can test this using the diagram above. Hold the
book at arm’s length, close your right eye, and focus on the
cross. Slowly move the book toward you. The center of
the wheel will disappear when it falls on your blind spot—
but your brain will ﬁll the gap with spokes of the wheel.

BRAIN GAMES

TRICKY

PICTURES

The optical illusions in this gallery all
play tricks on what your eyes and brain
think they are seeing. They stimulate
the eyes in such a way that still images
seem to move, colors change, and things
appear where they shouldn’t.

Is it straight?
The horizontal lines in this illusion appear to be wavy,
but they are all perfectly straight—use a ruler and see
for yourself! Our brains interpret the lines as being
wavy owing to the disjointed black-and-white lines
running from top to bottom, which can also make
some horizontal bands look closer than others.

Did that move?
The patterns in this picture appear to be
moving, but not if you stare at any spot for
a few seconds. This demonstrates what is
called peripheral vision drift. Our brains
perceive the colors and contrasts as moving
when we are not looking directly at them,
but the effect ends when we train our eyes
on one spot.

Ouch!
If you move your eyes around
d this pattern, called
the Ouchi illusion, the circle in the middle seems to
move or separate from the rectangular background,
and even hovers in front of itt. This illusion is not fully
understood, but it probably arises from the brain
being unsure of where the ciircle ends when you
are not looking directly at it.

Jumping goldﬁsh
Stare at the pink dot in the centre of the goldﬁsh’s head for 15 seconds
and then look at the black dot in the empty bowl. You should see the
goldﬁsh in its new home. This happens because an impression of the
goldﬁsh, called an afterimage, is still left on the back of your eye.

Seeing spots
This picture is called a scintillating grid because when
you look at it, dark spots seem to ﬂash (scintillate) in
the intersections between the squares. The reason for
this is yet to be explained, but if you tilt your head to
either side, it seems to lessen the effect.

Color contrasts
Which of these green crosses is lighter? Most people would
say the cross on the right. It might seem strange, but there is
actually no difference between them. This illusion is known as
simultaneous contrast, and it shows that the way we perceive
colors is based on their surroundings.

HOW YOU

SEE

Binocular vision
Each eye sees a slightly different image of the world. Try closing
one eye and framing a distant object with your hands. Then open
that eye and close the other. You will ﬁnd that your hands are
framing a different view. The images below show the different
views of the same setting seen by each eye.
eye The left eye can
see the palm trees behind the boat, while the right eye sees the
ﬂowering trees. You might expect this to confuse your brain,
but it combines the images to create a 3-D view.

Your eyes turn visual images into
o an
electronic code that can be processed
and stored in your brain. It is thiss mental
processing that determines how
w you
see the world. Without it, you could
not make sense of all the shapess
and colors. Your brain also
responds to some visual effects
by translating them into other
types of information. This enable
es
you to judge things like depth,
shape, and distance.

Perspective

Parallax
If you close one eye and look at a scene
without moving your head, it looks ﬂat
like a picture. But if you move your head
from side to side, you get an impression
of depth. This is because objects that are
closer to your eye seem to move more
than objects that are farther away, and
your brain translates the difference into
a perception of depth. This parallax effect
is obvious if you look out of the side
window of a moving car—nearby objects
like these pillars zip past, but distant
objects like the trees move hardly at all.

A oth
An
ther way your brain jud
ges distance is by decod
ing perspective.
This is the effect you ge
t when you look up at
a tall building and
the walls seem to lean
toward one another—eve

they are vertical. Your
brain makes an autom
atic calculation based
on this knowledge and
turns it into a percepti
on of height.

Some of the most effective optical illusions can be
produced with simple lines and shapes. Such illusions
play with our perceptions off angles, size, and shape,
causing us to make unconsccious assumptions about
what we see. Even when we
e know how they work,
the illusions are difﬁcult to shake off.

Deathly beauty

The Dutch artist M. C. Escher was inspired by optical
illusions. This picture shows a circuit of water that
seems to ﬂow impossibly uphill before tumbling
down to start its journey all over again. If you
look closely, you can see that the technique used
is the same as that in the Penrose triangle, below.

How good is your sense of hearing?
Throughout your life, your brain stores
information it encounters, enabling you to
identify the sounds you come across.

There is less air when the bottle is half
full, so the air vibrates faster, with higher pitch.
When the bottle is empty, the vibration is slower
and the pitch lower. But when you tap the bottle,
it is the glass and water that are vibrating to
create the sound. The greater the amount
of water, the lower the pitch.

Despite his musical genius, Mozart did not have a
one-track mind. He enjoyed horse riding, dancing,
and billiards. When he started earning serious
money in Vienna, he bought a billiard table as well
as a new piano. He was well known for his sense
of humor, partly because he enjoyed practical
jokes. He also liked showy clothes and was once
decribed as appearing onstage “with his crimson
pelisse and gold-laced cocked hat.”

Your taste buds can distinguish
between only ﬁve taste sensations:
salty, sour, sweet, bitter, and umani

limited to account for all the different
li
tastes that you experience, and this is
because your sense of smell also plays an
important role in “tasting” your food. Infections
such as colds and the ﬂu can make you
temporarily lose your sense of smell—

and then you ﬁnd that you cannot

Our sense of smell is
much more sensitive than
our sense of taste—around
10,000 times more
sensitive. It alerts us
to danger by detecting
poisonous odors and we
can even identify whether
food is ripe
p or rotten byy
smell alone.

Step 3
Ask the second person to
identify the ﬂavors. This
volunteer should not be
blindfolded. Record his
or her answers, too.

Step 1

Step 2

Pat the tongue of one of
your volunteers dry with
the paper towel so that
no part of the tongue’s
top side has saliva on it.
The second person can
taste the food as normal.

Ask the two subjects to
taste the dry food and then
record their responses as

they
can taste.

Step 4
Compare the differences
between the two
experiments. Did the
blindfolded person make
any mistakes or take longer
in identifying the ﬂavors?

We are used to
seeing foods in
certain colors, and
this helps identify
their ﬂavors.

Chemicals from food
can reach your taste buds
only if they have been
dissolved in saliva.

Although your brain
reacts strongly to new
sensory information from your skin,
it adapts to some constant or repetitive
messages to make them less distracting.
This effect happens with all the senses
but is most easily tested using touch.
If you put a pencil in the palm of your
hand, for example, you get an instant
sensation, but within seconds this wears
off to leave just a low-key awareness.
This is because some skin sensors soon
stop sending signals, but others don’t.

Illusion
A magician tosses a ball in the air twice
while following it with his eyes. But he fakes
a third toss, moving his eyes as if watching
the ball, and to you, the ball appears to vanish.
This illusion works because there is a slight
delay in visual data reaching your brain.
The brain compensates by inventing some
data to ﬁll the gap—sometimes it’s incorrect.

Step 1
Secretly place the Queen of
Diamonds so that it is the third
card from the top in the deck
of cards. Write down the name
of the card on a piece of paper
and put it in an envelope.

We rely on our senses to tell us about our surroundings.
However, our senses can be fooled, and we can easily
miss a trick if our brains are concentrating on something
else. Magicians distract their audiences to take attention
away from what is really going on. Try these tricks to ﬁnd
out if you, too, can fool the senses.

Step 3
Ask your friend to point to two
cards. If the ﬁrst two cards are
chosen, remove them and go to
Step 4. If the ﬁrst and third cards
are chosen, remove the middle one.
If the second and third cards are
chosen, remove the ﬁrst one. Then
ask your friend to choose another
card—whichever one is chosen,
make sure you remove the one
that isn’t the Queen of Diamonds.

Watch to see where the Queen of

to point to a row and conﬁdently
take away the row that doesn’t
have the Queen of Diamonds.

If you perform in a conﬁdent
manner, your friend will be
convinced that you are doing what
he or she has asked you to do.
In fact, you are doing exactly what
you need to do in order for the
Queen of Diamonds to be picked.

Step 4
Place the paper (which is still in the
shape of the cup) back over the coin.
Then smash your hand down on the
paper to show that the cup has
vanished. Say, “Oops, I’ve made the
wrong thing disappear!” Only you
know that you made the right object
vanish after all.

Step 1

Step 2

Place the coin on the table
and the cup over the coin.
Tell your friend you will
make the coin disappear.

Wrap the paper tightly
around the cup so that you
can see the shape of the cup
underneath the paper.

Step 3
Lift up the cup and the paper
to show that the coin is still
there. While you and your
friend are still looking at the
coin, move the paper and cup
over the edge of the table
and drop the cup out of the
paper into your lap.

Because you have
directed all the attention
to the coin, not the cup,
your friend’s brain isn’t
focusing on what is
really happening.

Balance
Your inner ear contains three bony tubes that
form loops called semicircular canals. Each
tube ends in a bulge, or ampulla, containing
sensors that detect the movement of ﬂuid
in the loop—which depends on your body’s
movement. Similar receptors called maculae
detect how upright you are. Your brain uses
these signals to correct your balance.

We normally think that we have ﬁve senses: sight,
hearing, taste, smell, and touch. But we also feel
things that do not seem related to a particular
sense. They are like an awareness of your body.
Most of these sensations affect your unconscious
mind, but that doesn’t make them unimportant.
Without your sense of balance, for example, you
could not stand upright.

BRAIN GAMES

INTUITION

We often believe
things without having
any idea why. You might
get a feeling that you
are being followed, or
arrive at an inspired
solution to a problem.
We call this intuition,
telepathy, or sometimes
a “sixth sense.” These
intuitive perceptions
are probably the result
of rapid unconscious
mental processes—
using either information
gathered by your senses
or data stored deep in
your memory.

Sixth sense
Have you ever felt that something was wrong without
understanding how you knew it? This “sixth sense” effect
can be quite creepy, but it is probably created by your brain
picking up some clue from your other senses and alerting
your alarm response without giving you the full picture.

What’s up? There’s
something wrong! The
house doesn’t feel
right at all!

Telepathy
Apparent telepathy is probably caused by a
combination of sensory awareness and shared
experience. Twins often seem telepathic because
they share
a the same history and thought patterns.

Female and male
Women are usually thought
to be more intuitive than
men. But psychological tests
show that this is not true,
and men score just as well.
It is simply that women like
t appear more intuitive,
to
i t iti
especially among friends.

Surprise!

Out of the blue
Sometimes someone grappling
with a problem ﬁnds that the solution
seems to come “out of the blue”
after working on something else
for a while. This is probably because
irrelevant details get forgotten, so the
main elements of the problem come
into sharper focus. The person may
also come across new information
that makes everything slot into place.

Ste
Stereotypes
Labeling leads us to create
cre
mental models of
all kinds of things
things,
ngs,
s from
f
animals to people and
social grou
groups. These are called stereotypes.
People
ople ar
are scared of snakes because they think
all snakes conform to a venomous stereotype.
In fact, this is a harmless grass snake,
showing that the stereotype is often wrong.
The brain’s habit of creating stereotypes
can be destructive, leading to social
problems such as racial prejudice.

When your brain registers sensory data as
important, it instantly labels
abels it as a pa
particular type
of experience
erience or pro
problem. This helps it devise a
rapid response without getting bogged down in
rap
detail. So once yyou realize that this is a snake,
you don’t go through a mental
al checklist to
assure yourself that you are right. You
label it, and take a step back. After
all, some snakes are venomous.

Often you see only partt of the picture and have to ﬁll
ﬁl in
the rest using data stored in your memory. A few clues
are often enough, because your brain is programmed
to make sense o
of sketchy information that might be
important to your safety. In this
th case, the animal’s
head looks familiar, so you mentally
ental ﬁll in the rest of
its body as that of a snake, which m
might be dangerous.
This happens before you get
et a good
go view of it.

Joining the dots

Your brrain processes your experiences
and all the information gathered by your
senses. Most of this data is discarded, but
the imp
portant perceptions, facts, and skills
are stored in your memory. This enables
you to think, learn, and be creative.

Ignored
Any information
in the sensory
memory that you
ignore is thrown
out right away.

Involuntary recall
Have you ever found yourself smelling
something and suddenly remembering
a certain time or place very strongly?
This sensation is called involuntary recall,
because your brain has retrieved the memory
by itself, without any prompting from your
conscious mind. Sounds and
nd sights can
also cause this, but smells are
especially powerful, perhap
ps
because the part of your brrain
that processes scent is clossely
sely
linked to your memory.

Trip method

1.Tree

One way to memorize a list is to visualize a trip
that you often take. Link each landmark on the trip
with an item on your list—the stranger the result,
the easier it is to remember! Then go through the
trip in your head to remember the items.

The leaves of the tree
are pages from a book.
Find a good book to
read on vacation.

This is a vacation to-do list, and here
is how to picture each of the items
with a landmark on a walk to school:
1. Find a book to read
2. Pack your sunglasses
3. Mail a letter
4. Buy some toothpaste
5. Hang your laundry
6. Remember your sun hat
7. Buy dog

BRAIN GAMES

Memory span
Your short-term memory can
store a certain amount of
information for a limited time.
This game reveals your brain’s
ability to remember numbers
and words. You may be
surprised at your own abilities.

Step 1
Starting at the top, read out loud each line of
numbers, one at a time. Cover up the line and then
try to repeat the numbers. Work your way down
the list until you can’t remember them all.
Most people can hold only seven
numbers at a time in their short-term
memory, so good job if you could
remember more.

438
7209
18546
907513
2146307
50918243
480759162

These games test your capacity for storing numbers, words,
and visual information in your memory. They also show the
two different ways we remember—recall and recognition.
Recall is ﬁnding information in your memory when you
need it. Recognition is knowing something when you see it.

1728406395

DO YOU

REMEMBER?

Visual memory
How good is your memory
for visual images? Study
these 16 pictures for
45 seconds. Then close
the book and write down
as many as you can.
How well did you do?

You’ve done well if you
have remembered more than
half the objects. More than
12 is an excellent result.

Fork, plate, glass, table

Step 2
Now read out these words, one line at a time.
Cover up the line and try to repeat the words.
Continue down the list until your memory fails.

Spider, tree, bird, ﬂower, dog
Pencil, scissors, chair, book, ﬁsh, clock
Pond, moon, star, grass, worm, bike, stone

Most people are better at remembering
words than numbers. If you can repeat a string
of eight words you have done very well.

Drum, bell, ball, racket, rope, box, net, pole
Eye, leg, arm, foot, head, ear, toe, hair, nose
Bread, milk, cookie, plate, bowl, plum, spoon,
apple, banana, orange

An artistic eye
Do you have a good memory
for remembering visual detail?
Try this test and see.

Recognition vs. recall
This game clearly shows you the
difference between recognizing
and recalling information.
Step 1

Step 1

First test your recognition
skills. Below are ten
countries and ten capital
cities. In 30 seconds, see how
many you can match up and
then turn to page 186 to
check your answers.
COUNTRIES
Israel
France
India
Russia
Czech Republic
Germany
Afghanistan
Canada
Denmark
Argentina

CAPITALS
New Delhi
Ottowa
Berlin
Prague
Copenhagen
Jerusalem
Buenos Aires
Kabul
Paris
Moscow

Look at the picture right
and closely study it for
two minutes. You may ﬁnd
it helpful to draw it. Then
cover up the picture and try
to draw it from memory.
When you think you’ve
ﬁnished, compare your
drawing to the picture and
give yourself a point for
every line you got right.

Step 2
Now do the same with this
picture, left, but this time
look for familiar shapes
or patterns. For example,
does it look like a kite?
Again, after two minutes
cover up the picture and
try to draw it. Figure out
your score again and
compare it with the
previous one.

Step 2
Here are another ten countries, but this time you need to
try to recall their capital cities in 30 seconds. Check your
answers again and then compare your two scores.
Spain
Ireland
China
Sweden
Iraq
Netherlands
s
Japan
Italy
Egypt
Greece
Most people get a better score ffor recognition
iti th
than
recall. This is because having a list of possible answers
gives your brain a shortcut to ﬁnding the information
stored in your memory.

You probably did better in the second
test than the ﬁrst because associating the
lines with familiar shapes makes them
easier to remember.

your short-term memory to work, ﬁrst testing how well you

At last the backyard looked
perfect. Jenny admired the orange
lanterns hanging from the trees as they
glowed in the fading light and the pretty
tables dotted around the yard, decorated
with candles and pink roses. There was
a table laden with champagne, a white
chocolate cake, a whole salmon, and
a tall pyramid of strawberries.
Jenny began to feel excited. Her parents
had no idea about the party. They thought
they were just going to the movies.
Suddenly, she heard a familiar noise
that ﬁlled her with alarm—a dog panting.
Chester! She had locked him in the
kitchen. How had he gotten out? A big,
muddy, wet, and very smelly dog raced
up and proudly dropped a dead ﬁsh

feet. Jenny knew where that had co

You can also use number pictures to help you
with lists. Imagine you need to buy six eggs,
three cartons of milk, two bananas, and eight
stamps. Visualize the objects on the list with
the number pictures—a rabbit eating an egg,
a worm drinking milk, a swan with a banana
in its beak, and a stamp with the picture of
a doughnut on it, for example. The crazier
the picture, the better, because it’s
it s more
likely to stick in your mind.

Making links between objects—

Einstein was

When you think of genius, you think of Einstein. This
is partly because his ideas are beyond most people’s
understanding—the bending of light and the distortion
of space, for example. He is most famous for his theories
of relativity, which explain how the universe works, and for
the equation E=mc2, which has become an icon of inspired

HOW WE

LEARN

Find wallet

Learning is vital to survival. We often think it is all about
skills like reading and writing, but it also involves developing
life skills such as safely crossing the street, dealing with
other people, and managing money.
ey.
We learn these things through a
combination of conscious effort
and unconscious reactions, and
everything we learn becomes
part of our long-term memory.

How much will it cost?

Take money

Conditioning

Learning curve
When we are young, we all have to learn a huge
amount about the world in a short time. We learn
basic skills like walking, eating, and avoiding harm.
We discover that everything we do makes other
things happen, and we learn how to predict this—
and maybe avoid it. We learn much more in our ﬁrst
few years than we do in all of the rest of our lives.

If an experience always follows a particularr
event, or does so only once but is very
upsetting, this can create such a
strong link in the brain that you react
automatically to the event if it happens
again. So, for example, if you have
been stung by a wasp, you get nervous
when you see another one—or any insect
with yellow and black stripes. This basic
form of learning is called conditioning.

Association
You learn by making connections between
different experiences and skills, creating a
web of associated ideas in your brain. When
one part of the web is activated, it ﬁres up
the rest. If you decide to buy a magazine, for
example, this idea triggers an association with
the store, the bicycle you will use to get there,
the route, the money you will need, and so on.
Association also allows you to link the abstract
ideas you learn in your classes at school.

Put in the practice
If you keep repeating
p
something to yourself,
you will remember it. This is because
the repetition links brain cells into a memory
circuit. You can learn a skill like playing the piano
in the same way, creating circuits in your brain that
enable you to play each tune. Repetitive practice
can be dull, but its beneﬁts last a long time.
Musicians can stop playing for a year or more, yet
quickly pick up the skills if they start playing again.

The one-hand rule
To get through a maze where all the walls are
connected to the outer boundary, you can use the
“one-hand rule.” To do this, always keep a hand on
one wall as you go—it doesn’t matter which hand, but
don’t swap along the way. Try this method to make your
way to the center of this maze—and back out again.

MASTERING

The brain’s ability to learn
helps us solve all sorts of
problems, including how to
ﬁnd our way out of a maze.
Giant hedge mazes are
popular attractions—it
seems that people like the
feeling of getting lost for a
while, as long as they can
eventually ﬁnd their way
to freedom, of course! See
if you can make your way
through this collection
of miniature mazes.
If you get lost, ﬁnd the
solutions on page 186.

MAZES

Right or left?
You can ﬁnd your way through
this more complicated maze
using the one-hand rule, too.
Once through, try again using
your other hand—which
route is quicker?

Trial and error
Mazes like this one, where some of the
walls are not connected to the others,
cannot be solved using the one-hand
rule. Instead you’ll have to ﬁnd your way
through by learning from yyour
mistakes. Find your way to the
center of the maze and the

Amazing mazes
The bigger and more complicated
a maze is, the more difﬁcult it is

paths pass under and over
one another can make it
difﬁcult to keep track of
where you’re going—so you’ll
have to pay attention. Using
the one-hand rule will take you
back out the way you came in,
so to ﬁnd the exit you’ll have
to use trial and error.

Bodily intelligence
The ability to effectively use your body is not
normally associated with intelligence, but it does
involve intellectual skills. You need certain mental
abilites to coordinate the movements that are
essential to sports and other physical activities.

Interpersonal intelligence

This covers the sympathetic understanding that
is vital if you are to relate to the motivations and
desires of other people. It enables you to give
good advice to friends who may have problems
but also allows you to work effectively with others.

*RRGE\H"

This type of intelligence involves a sensitivity to
written and spoken language. It may enable people
to easily learn languages, but it also includes the
ability to use language to express yourself and
communicate complex information.

This is a form of intelligence that gives a person the
ability to appreciate, perform, and compose musical
patterns. It involves recognizing and working with
musical pitches, tones, and rhythms and is similar
to linguistic intelligence.

Linguistic intelligence

Musical intelligence

Anyone
yone with the ability to navigate accurately and
visualize things in three dimensions is using their
spatial intelligence. It also covers the skills involved
in sports like tennis and many forms of art, such
as architecture and sculpture.

Sp
patial intelligence

This is when someone has the ability to logically
analyze problems, detect patterns, and carry out
mathematical calculations. It covers both scientiﬁc
and mathematical thinking, so it may also apply
to people who rarely use mathematics.

One aspect of intelligence is the ability to

as knowing how you “tick” and being able to use
that information to regulate your life.

This type of intelligence enables you to recognize,

environment. It covers your ability to make sense
of the natural world, but it may also affect how
you respond to any environment.

Naturalist intelligence

Various tests have been devised to measure
intelligence. The results are given a
numerical value called an intelligence
quotient, or IQ. IQ tests usually involve
general knowledge, arithmetic,
reasoning, memory, puzzle solving,
decoding, and analyzing shapes. But
they do not rate things like interpersonal
skills and may not be fair to people from
different cultural backgrounds.

Intelligence quotient

American psyc

began to ques
tion the notion
of a single type
of intelligence
in the 1970s, an
d he published
his theory of m

Although his th

it has helped un

measured by IQ
tests.

Carver was named after his slave owner, Moses
Carver, who raised the orphan as his own child
after abolition. Eventually, George got a place
in school and later went to college. At ﬁrst
he studied art and music, but in 1891, he
transferred to Iowa State Agricultural College,
where he was the ﬁrst black student.

An African American born in the South before the
abolition of slavery, George Washington Carver fought
racism to become a respected scientist, educator, and
inventor. His main interest was agriculture, especially
promoting crops that poor farmers could grow for food
and other purposes. In the process he improved the
lives of people often too poor to help themselves. His
achievements helped undermine racial prejudice and
blazed a trail for other African Americans to follow.

He stayed at Tuskegee for 47 years, teaching the
students farming techniques and ways of becoming
self-sufﬁcient. The head of the institute called

Use your head
Logic involves using sound reasoning to
draw the right conclusions from known
facts. If you cannot fault the reasoning,
it is likely that the conclusions are
correct. Checking the reasoning is an
important part of logical thinking.
But perfectly good reasoning is
no use if the basic facts are wrong,
so you have to check those as well.

Testing the argument
T
The ability to test the argument is important when you can’t test
th
he conclusion. Bacteria are well known to cause tooth decay,
so it is logical to argue that a toothpaste that destroys bacteria
will help prevent tooth decay. You have to trust the logic,
w
because you have no way of testing the effect on your teeth.

Persuasive logic
Many people use logic to persuade
others. If someone says something
that you don’t believe but then backs
it up with a solid logical argument,
you might start to believe it. But if
there is no logical argument to back it
up, you will not be persuaded. This
makes logic very important for lawyers
and politicians such as Hillary Clinton.

Logic and philosophy

Computer logic

The intellectual discipline of philosophy, ﬁrst practiced by the
ancient Greeks, is mostly about logic, because it uses reasoned
argument to investigate concepts such as truth, beauty, and
justice. To many people, these exercises are intellectual games,
as we believe we know the answers through common sense.
But common sense can be misleading if it is based on false
ideas. The rigorous, logical argument encouraged by the
study of philosophy has real practical value.

Logic is vital to computing. All
computers are controlled by long
strings of electronic instructions
called programs. These are
devised by programmers who
have to convert their ideas into
a code that a comp
puter can read.
If the coded in
nstructions are not
logical, the program will not work.

Checking the facts
Very often people come up with conclusions that are based on ideas
that are wrong. If making teeth shiny really did make them healthy,
the argument in this advertisement would be ﬁne. But simply
brushing your teeth does not prevent tooth decay, so the facts
are wrong. It’s important to check the facts as well as the logic.

Free association
When you think logically,
you retrieve information
from your memory and
use it to solve problems.
But sometimes your
mind wanders and
makes associations
without conscious
direction. This tends
to happen when you
are very relaxed.

Instinct
We all have natural instincts
that make sure we get things
like food, water, and air.
Instincts also include
some emotions such
as the fear of ﬁerce dogs.
These instincts are the type
of thinking that is shared
by animals, but they are
not governed by logic. This
does not mean that instincts
do not make sense—they are
essential to our survival.

Faith
All religions are based on
faith, which involves believing in
something that cannot be proved.
There is no logical reason to
believe in a god, but a lot of
people do—even if they do not
practice any religious rituals—
including many scientists who
normally rely on logical thinking.

Superstition
Many people are superstitious. They avoid walking under
ladders, worry about what may happen on Friday the 13th,
or believe in ghosts. Most of us try to avoid saying things like
“I’ve never been in a car accident” because we feel that we
are increasing the risk just by saying it, or “tempting fate.”
There is no logic in this way of thinking.

The frustrat
a ed farmer
A farmer is trying to use a small boat to row
a fox, a chicken, and a bag of corn across a river.
However, he can take only one thing at a time
in the boat. If he leaves the fox with the chicken,
the fox will eat the chicken. If he leaves the
chicken with the corn, the chicken will eat
the corn. How can the farmer get across the
river without anything eating anything else?

Carnival m
money
oney
Three boys arrive at a carnival on Sunday
morning. The man in the ticket booth tells them
that the entrance fee is $10 each—so the boys pay
$30 and enter the carnival. However, the man in
the ticket booth realizes that tickets cost less on
Sundays, so the boys should have paid only $25.
The man asks his assistant to go ﬁnd the boys and
give them $5 back. The assistant can’t ﬁgure out
how to split $5 between three people, so he keeps
$2 for himself and gives the boys $1 each. This
means that the boys have now paid $9 each for
their tickets—a total of $27—and the assistant
has kept $2, making $29 . . . What happened to
the other $1?

It might help if you make paper
cutouts of the characters to help
you visualize the solution.

Rob has just won a game of pass the package.
It started with nine children sitting in a circle. A
package was given to the ﬁrst player, who then
passed it to the left to player number two and they
continued in this way until the package reached
the seventh player. This person then unwrapped a
layer of paper and was eliminated from the game.
The person to their left then became player
number one and the game continued until there
was only one person left to claim the prize. If

Many number puzzles rely on logical
thinking rather than math skills.
Sudoku and Kakuro, for example, are
puzzles you solve by ﬁlling in blank
squares with the right numbers
according to certain logical rules.

The classic Sudoku puzzle consists
of a 9 x 9 grid of squares divided into
nine boxes of nine squares. Every
vertical column, horizontal row, and box
must contain the numbers 1 through 9.
Some squares already contain numbers,
and your job is to ﬁgure out which
numbers go in the empty squares.
Start with this puzzle and pick up
some tips and tricks before moving
on to try a few more on your own.

Another trick is to look for
sets of three numbers, known
as “triplets.” Look at the middle
column of three boxes, shaded
gray. The top two already
contain 1. This means that
1 must go in the right-hand
column of the bottom box.
Check the rows and you’ll
realize there’s only one place
the other 1 can go.

A good place to look ﬁrst is
the row or column with the most
numbers. Here, the middle row
is missing only 2 and 8. If you
check the rest of the numbers in
the vertical columns that the
middle row’s blank squares sit
in, you should be able to ﬁgure
out which numbers go where.

If you have to pack a lot of items

arrangement in your bedroom.

A map is like an aerial view

Liftoff
Born in 1912, von Braun developed a
passion for astronomy when he was a child.
Inspired by the rocket-powered vehicles of
Fritz von Opel and the work of rocket
pioneer Hermann Oberth, he became
obsessed by space travel and joined the
Spaceﬂight Society at the University of
Berlin to assist Oberth in rocket research.

Wernher von Braun was a visionary inventor: a man who
saw the future and made it happen. He was the scientist
behind the Saturn V rocket that carried men to the Moon,
and he masterminded the development of the smaller
rockets that preceded it. He also had ambitious plans
for an orbiting space station and manned ﬂights to
Mars. But all this was based on his early experience
developing the deadly V-2 missile for Nazi Germany.

Relaunch
In 1945, von Braun surrendered to the
American forces, who took him to the
U.S. Eventually, he was joined by a team
of 127 technicians who had worked on
the V-2 rocket program. Their task was
to develop the V-2 into a nuclear missile.
However, in 1958, one of von Braun’s
rockets was used to launch the ﬁrst
U.S. satellite, Explorer 1. This marked
the beginning of the space race
between Russia and the U.S. that
was to lead to the Moon landings.

A captured V-2 rocket is launched
British scientists in October 1945 by
, soon
after the war ended.

Wrong target
In the late 1930s, the German Nazi authorities
persuaded von Braun to develop the V-2 rocket as
a weapon. Yet von Braun always said that he was
really only interested in space travel. On hearing
the news that the ﬁrst operational V-2 had hit
London, England, he said, “The rocket worked
perfectly except for landing on the wrong planet.”

Rocket science
While he was working on the ﬁrst American
rockets, von Braun came up with some
ambitious plans for space exploration.
He devised a huge manned orbiting space
station and ﬁgured out ways of mounting
expeditions to the Moon and even Mars.
He later worked as an adviser to Walt
Disney, who was making TV shows
about space travel.

Grounded
Eventually it became clear that von Braun’s
Saturn rocket was going to be replaced by
the space shuttle, which is not suitable for
missions beyond Earth orbit. Von Braun’s
hopes for more expeditions to the Moon and
planets were shattered, and in 1972, he stopped
working for the American space program. Soon
after this he became ill, dying in 1977. Yet he
had achieved his main ambition of sending
astronauts into space—and to the Moon.

Babies are very sensitive to words and
speech patterns, and by two years old
they know around 300 words. They start
linking them together until, at the age
of four, most children can say simple
sentences. By age ﬁve or six they can
put together more complex sentences.

If I am very good and eat

Learning another language is easy when we are
very young, because at this age our brains respond
to every new stimulus. Some children even pick up two
languages at once. But it becomes harder with age, and
many adults ﬁnd it is almost impossible (unless they live
for a while in a country where the language is spoken).
Some people do better than others, possibly because
the language-processing areas of their brains are bigger.

Second language

Pretty Polly!

You can teach a parrot to
speak, but you can’t teach it
to have a real conversation.
The parrot just learns to
repeat the sounds, and
may understand when to
say particular phrases, but
it cannot put together its
own sentences. This skill is
uniquely human.

Parrot fashion

Our complex language is one of the features that makes humans
different from other animals. A parrot may be able to talk, but it
cannot use language to explain what it is thinking. Speaking is
not just about making the right sounds—it is about using sounds
to communicate. We learn this when we are very young, but we
keep adding to our verbal skills throughout our lives.

HAVING A

WORD

When you talk or write, your brain searches
through your vocabulary to pick out the words
you need to express yourself. The following
games test your understanding of the
relationships between words and also show
how easily your brain can become confused
when you read words in a strange context.
Check your answers on page 189.

Quick comparisons
Figuring out the relationships between
words is the ﬁrst step to correctly using
them. Choose the right word to complete
the sentences below.

2
The ﬁrst player chooses a
piece of pa
aper and reads out
the word, an

player has to say a similar
word. If the noun is “yacht,”
y
he or she could say “ship” or if the adjective
is “cold,” he or she could suggest “ffreezing.”

The game continues with the remaining
words until the player pauses for mo

The two players take
turns to talk on a topic
for 30 seconds, without
repeating words or
pausing for too long.
The topics are decided
by the quizmaster, who
also keeps time.

Step 2

Step 3

At the word “go,” player 1
starts to talk. Challenges
can be made at any point
if player 2 feels a rule
has been broken—the
quizmaster’s decision is
ﬁnal. If the challenger is
correct, he or she continues
the talk. The player who is
speaking when the time
is up wins the point.

Next it is the turn
of player 2 to start to
speak on a new subject.
After three turns each,
you could increase the
time to a minute for
each speech.

Words as art
Some forms of writing are so
beautiful that they are treated
as an art form. In the past, many
people in the West learned graceful
forms of handwriting—an art known
as calligraphy that is still enjoyed by
some today. In Chinese, every new
word requires a different character,
and this gives calligraphy a practical
function because the writer can invent
an entirely new character to express
a particular idea. Such characters
are works of art in their own right.

Some people have a ﬂair for learning languages. They
catch on to what is being said, learn how to reply, and
are soon able to ﬂuently read and write the language.
Jean François Champollion was a genius at this.
But he didn’t just learn the languages of his own age.
He found a way of using his skill to decipher a language
that had been long forgotten, enabling scholars to
rediscover the lost world of ancient Egypt.

Sanskrit, and Chaldean. Eventually
he became an assistant professor
of history, specializing in ancient

Keystone
In 1799, a French army captain discovered a
stone slab near the Egyptian port of Rashid,
or Rosetta. The “Rosetta stone” was covered
with writing in three languages: Egyptian
hieroglyphs, another form of Egyptian writing
called demotic, and classical Greek. But all three
were versions of the same thing—a document
issued by Pharaoh Ptolemy V in 196 B.C.E. Enough
of the writing remained to allow the hieroglyphs
to be related to the Greek and decoded—
but it would prove difﬁcult.

A dotty challenge
Can you draw four straight lines,
without lifting your pen from the page,
to connect all the red dots? You will need
to think outside the box on this!
When taking up a
challenge such as this, you
may need to take one or two
different approaches. If you
don’t get it right the ﬁrst
time, keep starting from
a different point
until it works.

Natural talent
Mother nature is often the best designer and
has provided inspiration for some important
inventions. See if you can match the invention
on the left with the inspiration on the right.
1. Shinkansen bullet train
2. Futuristic car
3. Swimsuit
4. Self-cleaning paint
5. Road reﬂectors

A. Shark’s skin
B. Lotus leaf
C. Cat’s eyes
D. Trunkﬁsh
E. Kingﬁsher’s beak

The ﬁeld of science referred to above is
known as biomimicry, which means “imitating
nature.” The next time you are in a park or
garden, see if you can ﬁnd inspiration or new
ideas from the things you see around you.

Illustrated stories
Choose a painting—from an art book or from
the Internet! Study the picture for a while and
focus on the details. Let your mind wander and
then try to create a story around it.

Being able to understand
and interpret artwork is
a good creative exercise,
as the brain thinks about what
at
the artwork is showing and
d
draws on what it means.
By basing your story on
something that inspires you
u,
you may create something
impressive yourself.

Back to basics
What can you do with an empty
cardboard box? Use your imagination
and see if you can design something
brilliant. Of course, you could always
just copy our idea, but where’s the
fun in that?
Some of the greatest inventors have
taken simple things and used them in
a new way. You don’t always need
elaborate materials to come up with
great ideas!

BOOST YOUR

CREATIVITY

Many techniques designed to
improve creative thinking encourage
you to break away from strict logic
and ﬁxed ideas and let your mind
wander more freely around a
problem. This is often called
“thinking outside the box.” It
helps you see things from different
angles and come up with the fresh
ang
approaches you need
ed to be creative.
creative

Brainstorming
This involves thinking up as many ideas
as possible without judging them. You can do
this alone, but it is usuallyy a g
group
p activity,
y with
someone writing all the ideas down. It can be fun!
When everyone has run ou
ut of ideas, you look at
the list and see what you have. Sometimes the
oddball ideas turn out to be the best ones.

Vis
sual thinking
Instea
ad of making simple lists of ideas, you can turn them
iinto
t a diagram
diagram. You start with a central problem, such as
global warming, and add a series of spreading
di branches
depicting all the related facts, ﬁgures, and ideas. This can
work like a visual form of brainstorming, with new ideas
leading to more radical, creative ones.

Lateral thinking
Similar to brainstorming, latera
al
thinking is all about approachin
ng
a problem from every possible
angle. The basic idea is to
identify the “normal” way of
looking at a problem and avoid
it. You use a random way of
triggering new trains of though
ht,
such as letting a book fall open
n,
sticking a pin on the page, and
seeing how the word it hits
might relate to the problem.
It sounds crazy, but it can be
surprisingly effective.

What if...?

I WA

One way of moving beyond ﬁxed ideas
is to ask, “What if . . .?” You could ask,
“What if all bus travel was free?” and
this might lead to creative thinking
g
about the way we get around and the
role of cars. It could be a negative
question, such as “What if no one
collected our garbage?” You could
then ﬁgure out ways of dealing witth
the problem. Or the question could
d
be impractical in itself, such as “W
What
if our pets could talk?” This might
seem like a fantasy, but it could
stimulate useful ideas about
how we treat animals.

One of the most intelligent people ever to have lived,
Leonardo da Vinci is famous for the amazing breadth of
his interests. Primarily a painter of extraordinary skill,
he became fascinated by the human body and pioneered
the science of anatomy. He also became a practical
engineer and inventor, dreaming up all kinds of
astonishing devices that were way ahead of their time.

Amazing artist
Leonardo was born near Florence, Italy,
in 1452. When he was 15, his father sent
him to work as an apprentice for the
Florentine painter Andrea del Verrochio.
He soon became a superbly realistic
painter of human ﬁgures, partly because
of his interest in anatomy. He worked very
slowly, and during the late 1400s, he
completed only six paintings in 17 years.
His most famous painting is the Mona Lisa,
probably painted in around 1505.

Visionary engineer
In 1482, Leonardo got a well-paid job with
the duke of Milan by describing himself as
a military engineer. Luckily he was much
more talented than most engineers of the
time. He was interested in water power
and came up with many devices driven by
water wheels. Later, he proposed a bridge
across the Gulf of Istanbul, which would
have been the longest single-span bridge
in the world, but it was never built.

Many of Leonardo’s inventions were
objects that could not be made at the
time but have since become a reality.
He devised a form of parachute, a glider,
a type of bicycle, a life jacket to keep a
person aﬂoat, an underwater breathing
device, weapons that could be used to
attack ships from underwater, and an
“unsinkable” double-hulled ship. He
even came up with this pioneering
concept for a helicopter (left).

Gruesome fascination
Leonardo was fascinated by human anatomy.
He spent hours dissecting human corpses and
drawing what he saw. This gruesome activity
was considered suspicious, and was even
forbidden by the pope himself, but Leonardo was
not easily put off. He pressed on, producing many
drawings, which he considered a much better
way of describing anatomical features than
written descriptions. Many of his drawings
are remarkably detailed and accurate.

SELF
You know who you are. You recognize
yourself in mirrors and pictu
ures. You
have an image of yourself that includes
your personality and your be
eliefs about
how others see you. This sellf-awareness
enables you to think about yo
our identity
and how you relate to other people. It is
what we call consciousness..

That’s me!

Self-esteem

If you put a cat in front of a mirror, it may not
react at all. Birds don’t recognize themselves
either; instead, some see a rival and try to drive
it away. Human babies are similar, but at the
age of around 18 months, they know who they are
looking at—they have developed a sense of self.

We all have an idea of how we would
like to be. If we think we don’t match up
to this ideal, we feel bad about ourselves—we have
low self-esteem. Quite often the ideal is not realistic,
but sometimes our judgment of our self is inaccurate
and we are actually closer to the ideal than we think.

Self-image

Consciousness

Your sense of self is made up of your personal history
combined with your own idea of your personality and physical
appearance, as well as how others see you. If you are lucky,
you will have a positive self-image, but some people have
negative ideas that distort their self-image. For example,
very shy people think others are judging them all the time.

No one really knows what consciousness is,
but we all have it. It has been described as
an awareness of our own existence and our
thought processes. So it is partly about your
identity but also about your ability to think,
plan, and analyze your thoughts and plans.

Individuality
Western cultures tend to
celebrate the variations in
personality that make us
individuals. Some other
cultures discourage them.
However, we all seem to
be getting bolder about our
individuality, and we often
display this in the way we
dress and behave. Ideally,
we would all feel conﬁdent
as individuals while
staying responsible
members of society.

Nature and nurture
Your experiences can have a big effect on your
personality. If your best friend is run over by a bus,
for example, it affects your outlook. But although
these twins may have been affected in different
ways by their personal histories, they probably
react to new experiences in similar ways.

your sc
gure out

Everyone has a little of each of the
ﬁve personality types, but in varying
amounts. You can be open as well as neurotic
or a conscientious extrovert. Each of the ﬁve
traits is independent from the others.

Neuroticism
If your score was high, you are likely
to be emotionally sensitive and high
strung. You might get worried, upset, or
excited more easily than others do. A low
score usually means you are a calm and
relaxed type who rarely gets emotional.

Agreeableness
A high score means you are easy to get along
with and very cooperative. If your score was
low, perhaps you can be argumentative or
too outspoken. Most people become more
agreeable as they get older.

Extroversion
Extroverts love talking to people and are very
conﬁdent. They crave excitement and fun and are
often thrill seekers who like danger. The opposite
of an extrovert is an introvert. Introverts prefer to
be socialize with one or two good friends rather
than a big group of people of people who they
might not know. Introverts can often be shy.

Conscientiousness
A high score means that you are sensible, reliable,
and hard working. People who are conscientious try
to do their best in everything and are often very neat
and organized. They can also be a little fussy. If your
score was low, you may be a little disorganized and
ﬁnd ﬁnishing homework, or doing chores, very dull.

Openness
If you are very open, you like to experience new
things and you welcome change. You prefer spur-ofthe-moment decisions to making plans, and you
probably have a number of hobbies that you dip in
and out of. If your score was low, you probably prefer
to be in familiar surroundings and like routine. You
may have one hobby that you are absorbed in.

1. When a friend is upset, do you feel upset, too?
2. Do you notice the big picture rather than the
little details?
3. Do you pay attention to someone’s body
language when they’re talking to you?
4. Are you happier when you are talking about
people you know rather than about television
and computer games?
5. Do you understand written information
more easily than maps and diagrams?

Male or female brain?
Answer these quick questions and then
turn to page 189 to ﬁnd out whether
you have male- or female-type skills.

The bike test
People with predominantly male brains
are better at noticing small details than
those with female brains. A good way to
demonstrate this is to ask a selection
of friends, both male and female, to draw
a bicycle from memory in 30 seconds.
Compare their drawings. People with
a male brain tend to draw bikes that
are fairly close to the real thing,
ng, with a
frame and saddle. Those with a female
brain are more likely to draw
something that could never
work as a bike but may
include a rider.

We all behave in different ways, and
one important inﬂuence is the brain.
Some psychologists believe that there
are two main types of brains—male and
female—each with different skills. Have
you also noticed that some people are
full of energy when others are thinking
of going to bed? Why is this? Find out
more about how your brain affects
your behavior with these exercises.

Testosterone is the male sex

causes changes in the body), but
it is present in girls, too. If you had

Born in England in the last year of the 1700s,
Mary Anning was a self-taught pioneer of the new
science of geology. She had a genius for ﬁnding the
fossil remains of extinct animals and was considered
an expert by some of the most eminent scientists
in Europe. Yet she achieved all this at a time when
women were barred from academic life.

Jurassic coast
Mary lived in Lyme Regis on the
“Jurassic coast” of southern England—
so named because the cliffs contain
fossils dating from the Jurassic period
of the age of dinosaurs. In the early
1800s, such “curiosities” were not
understood, but they were eagerly
sought by visiting gentlemen
naturalists. If they could not ﬁnd
any, they could buy them from
local collectors like Mary.

Marine reptiles
Mary made her ﬁrst major discovery in 1811, after
her brother found the fossilized skull of what he
thought was a crocodile. It took her a whole year
to uncover the complete skeleton of an ichthyosaur,
a prehistoric marine reptile that resembled
a dolphin. It was the ﬁrst ever found. She sold
the fossil to a rich local man, who sold it on to a
museum in London. She was then only 12 years old.

Carl Jung
Swiss psychologist Carl Jung believed
in the collective unconscious—a mass
of buried memories inherited from our
ancestors. He thought this explained the
ghost stories, myths, and fairy tales that
are part of every culture. However, since
Jung’s death in 1961, his theory has been
displaced by other ideas.

Links with reality
A dream often turns out to be your sleeping
brain’s explanation of something that is really
happening. If a cat is yowling outside your
bedroom window, you might dream about
someone singing really badly! In one test,
sleepers sprayed lightly with cold water said
they dreamed of bathing, ﬂoods, or rain.

Scrambled events

Dreams usually link together a whole series
of strange events. One minute you are riding
through the house on a horse and the next
minute you and the horse are having lunch.
Your brain seems to have a large collection of
images, which it uses to form a story. You realize
how crazy the story is only when you wake up.

The imag
ges that appear in dreams may be
symbolic of something else. If you were to
dream of being on a desert island, it might be
because you want to escape from your normal
life. This idea was once an important part of
a therapy called psychoanalysis, but there is
no evidence that dreams really work like this.

Hidden meanings

151

(c) 2011 Dorling Kindersley. All Rights Reserved.

Some people suffer from a sleep disorder where
they get up and do things such as dressing,
bathing, or even using the vacuum cleaner—
but without waking up. Afterward, they cannot
remember what they have done. Sleepwalking
is not a form of dreaming, because it occurs
during a different phase of sleep.

Some people believe that dreams predict the
future. In fact, most dreams simply reﬂect our
concerns, and sometimes these coincide with
real events. If you are worried about being
told off by your teacher, you are likely to
dream about it. So if your teacher does tell you
off the next day, your dream has come true!

Some of our strangest experiences happen in our dreams.
We all have dreams—even if we don’t remember them very
well—so we know how illogical and strange they can be. Yet
dreams also conjure up people and events that we recognize
from our normal waking lives. Scientists are still trying to
understand the meaning of dreams and why we have them.

Most scientists now agree that dreams are
part of the brain’s housekeeping activities.
As you sleep, your brain sorts out the events
that have happened during the day and
commits many of them to long-term memory.
In the process, it triggers other memories,
and these get knitted together into dreams.

Mental housekeeping

Emotional
intelligence
Our ability to control and make use of
emotion is sometimes seen as a form of
intelligence. The man below is using his
emotional intelligence to recognize his
friend’s unhappiness and comfort her.
This is a social skill that also raises
awareness of your own emotions.

Controlling emotion
As we grow, the part of the brain
responsible for conscious control
grows, too, and we learn to control
our emotions. The man on the right
below is annoyed by his neighbor
eating popcorn, but he is managing to
stop himself from getting angry.

Mahatma

Gandhi

We do not often link politics with genius.
Yet some political ﬁgures have the genius
to see problems in a new way and use
this insight to change history. One of the
greatest was Mahatma Gandhi, the leader
of the Indian independence movement.
He pioneered resistance to authority by
nonviolent mass civil disobedience—an
idea that inspired movements for civil
rights and freedom across the world.

Rude awakening
Born in 1869 in Gujarat, India,
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
studied to become a lawyer. In 1893,
he went to work in South Africa on
a 12-month contract and came
face-to-face with racism when he
was thrown off a train for refusing
to give up his ﬁrst-class seat. He
became a political agitator, staying
in South Africa to help resident
Indians obtain the right to vote.

Nonviolent protest
In 1906, the South African government tried to
force resident Indians to carry registration cards.
Gandhi called on Indians to defy the law but not
use violence. During a seven-year campaign,
thousands were jailed, beaten, or even shot—
yet Gandhi stood ﬁrm. Eventually this harsh
treatment of peaceful protesters forced
the government to negotiate with Gandhi.
Nonviolent protest had won its ﬁrst victory.

Great soul
Gandhi returned to British-ruled India in 1915
and became involved in the independence struggle.
He campaigned against the unfair taxation of poor
villagers, earning the name Mahatma, or “great
soul.” He always advocated nonviolent protest,
even after the 1919 Amritsar Massacre in which
British-commanded soldiers opened ﬁre on an
unarmed gathering, killing at least 379 people.

Amyg
a
Triggedala
respo rs fear
nse

Fear is related to anger, and
between the two they trigger the
“ﬁght or ﬂight” response. This
might give you the strength to
wrestle a crocodile, but if you didn’t
have faith in your chances, it would
also enable you to run away. The
same response might also prompt
you to rescue someone trapped
in a burning building.

Fight or ﬂight

When the fear response is activated, your
adrenal glands release chemicals such as
adrenaline into your bloodstream. These
chemicals combine with nerve signals to
push up your breathing rate, increase the
blood supply to your muscles, and intensify
your awareness. You are brieﬂy supercharged
with the strength you need to survive.

Supercharged

When faced with dangerous situations, it is important
to feel some level of fear. If you were not afraid of road
trafﬁc, for example, you might get knocked down by a
car or truck. Fear triggers physical reactions that give
you superpowers, so you can run away from a ﬁerce
dog and even jump over a fence to escape. However,
many of the situations that frighten us in modern life
do not require this type of physical response, and the
fear can lead to stress-related illnesses.

Many people use relaxation
techniques to reduce the effects of
fear-related stress. They include deep
breathing exercises, meditation, and yoga.
These can trigger a relaxation response,
which works like an antidote to the fear
response and helps you calm down.

Relaxation

When you get stressed, one way of dealing with the
problem is to work it off with physical exercise. This
uses up the chemicals that are supposed to
help you ﬁght or escape and makes you
feel better. Exercise also encourages other
parts of the brain to produce chemicals
called endorphins that improve your state
of mind and combat the effects of stress.

Working it off

Many of the events that frighten
us in modern life cannot be easily
resolved. Caught by his enemies, our
hero is more worried about how his
boss will react than anything else—
and he cannot ﬁght or run away from
his boss. There is nothing he can do,
so he just gets more upset. This
type of stress can cause
serious illness.

Body language

Faking it

Acting

Our body postures say a lot about how
we are feeling. Some are obvious, like
jumping for joy or slumping in defeat.
Many are harder to deﬁne and more
difﬁcult to pick up, but we can often
read such body language anyway—
especially when someone’s expression
doesn’t match up. The conﬁdent body
language but sad expression above
gives a strange mixed message.

We all try to conceal our emotions
sometimes. We try not to look
bored when visiting relatives or
try to look happy when we are sad.
Some people in public life make it
their business to smile all the time.
But the difference between a real
smile and a fake one is obvious if
you see them side by side—in a
real smile, the eyes smile, too.

Actors are judged by their abilityy to
express emotions that they do not
really feel. This can be difﬁcult,
so one performance technique,
known as “the Method,” involves
actors becoming immersed in
the thoughts and emotions of
the characters they are playing.
Sometimes they do this so well that
they get completely carried away.

It’s not only your words that say a lot
about you—your facial expressions and
the way you move your body do, too. In fact,
your body language often reveals a lot more
than you want it to, because you don’t realize
what you are doing. Try these exercises and
then check your answers on page 189 to see

Addiction

Programm
med behavior

The most destructive habits are called addictions.
The addictions that get in the news involve illegal drugs,
alcohol, and tobacco, but people can also become
addicted to things like sugary foods and chocolate.
If they keep eating them, they can get sick, but despite
this, they just can’t stop—they are stuck with a bad habit.

Habits are form
med by repeated pa
atterns of behavior
creating nerve networks in the brrain. These work
like the simple programs used in an appliance like a
washing machine—once it is turn
ned on, the program
runs by itself. So when you start b
brushing your teeth,
the habit progra
am takes over to ccomplete the job.

Useful routine

Bad habits

Every day you do things without thinking much about them,
because they are part of your daily routine. If something like
washing your face becomes a habit, it helps ensure that you
do it even if you’re thinking about something else. So habits are
valuable when they make life easier and encourage you to do
the things that you need to do, which you might otherwise forget.

Unfortunately, it’s very easy to p
pick up bad habits. A lot
of people bite their ﬁngernails o
or pick their noses. They
often do not know that they are doing it, because they
are thinking about something e
else. Sometimes this
doesn’t matter much, although it can be irritating for
others. But some bad habits ca
an be very damaging.

Triggers and prompts

Breaking
g a bad habit

Most habits are triggered by external signals. When
a driver sees a red light, it makes him or her perform a
series of actions that stops the car. It is like an instinct.
You can sometimes think up your own ways of prompting
useful habits—putting your toothbrush somewhere
obvious might prompt you to use it, for example.

A bad habit can
n be difﬁcult to break because it is wired
into your brain. Even if you manag
ge to overcome a bad
habit for severa
al months, the wiring is still there, ready
to be reactivate
ed by the relevant ttrigger. Time may help,
but often the be
est tactic is to replace a bad habit with a
less damaging one.

Most people who take up a sport are trying to win,
but this means that someone has to lose. The
difference is usually put down to ﬁtness and ability,
but when physical skills are evenly matched, the
winner is often the competitor who has the
right mental attitude. The same
is probably true of life.

Conﬁdence
Conﬁdence is vital to winning, and this
has been proved by research. In one study,
24 people had their arms strength tested
before an arm-wrestling match. The
researchers deceived the competitors
into believing that the weaker participants
were the stronger ones. In ten out of 12
contests, the weaker wrestlers won!

Setting goals
To get anywhere, you need
to set yourself goals. But
don’t go for the long-term
goal of being the champion—
you need short-term
personal targets that you
can try to hit every day. If you
are a cyclist, for example,
your short-term goal could
be to achieve a faster time
than before—regardless of
who wins the race. This will
increase your conﬁdence.

Visualization
Get in the right frame of mind by recalling the sensation
of success. Imagine yourself accepting the prize for ﬁrst
place—it feels good, doesn’t it? This feeling can help you
win. Also, before the event, visualize yourself moving
smoothly through the activity, and you are more likely
do it perfectly when it matters.

The most primitive animals do

enable them to respond to
en

of the brain that does this

enlarged in the human brain.
One part in particular—the

Super senses
For most animals, the main job of
the brain is to process data from the
senses. This function is often more
highly developed than it is in humans.
A dog has a much greater ability than
humans to identify scents, and some
owls can use sound alone to pinpoint
mice in total darkness. The brains of
these animals have a lot of mental
processing power, but compared to
us, it is used in different ways.

168

The part of the brain that seems to be the
main intellectual processing centre is the
bulge at the front, behind your forehea
ad—the
prefrontal cortex. This uses informatio
on from
the senses to form judgments, make choices,
and predict future events. It has expan
nded in
size throughout our evolution, pushin
ng the
human forehead forward compared to our
monkeylike ancestors. However, a stu
udy of
the brains of baboons—large monke
eys—has
shown that the human prefrontal corrtex is
not much bigger than theirs relative
e to the
rest of the brain. So it is likely that itts
structure has also changed.

English naturalist Charles Darwin revolutionized
d
the way we see the living world. His theory of
evolution by natural selection showed that
competition for scarce resources led to species
changing constantly through “the survival of the
ﬁttest.” Published in 1859, the theory was a ﬂash
of genius backed up by a mass of evidence—the
product of inspiration and a lot of hard work.

Distracted student
Born in England in 1809, Darwin went
to the University of Cambridge to study
for the church, but he was much more
interested in studying nature. He became
friends with John Stevens Henslow, a
professor of botany, and Adam Sedgwick,
one of the founders of modern geology.
In 1831, he was on a geology ﬁeld trip with
Sedgwick when Henslow suggested that
he join the survey ship HMS Beagle as
“ship’s naturalist” on an expedition to
chart the coastline of South America.

The voyage lasted ﬁve
years, and while the crew

Darwin spent most of his
time on land. He explored

found fossils of giant extinct

HOW THE BRAIN

GROWS

Most of the development of the bra
ain takes place before
a baby is born, so at birth the brain contains almost all the
nerve cells that it will ever have. During childhood, these
cells are rearranged into increasin
ngly complex networks
that allow us to learn and rememb
ber. The brain reaches
peak weight in early adulthood and then starts to shrink.

3 weeks

7 weeks

11 weeks

Beginnings
During the early stages of a baby’s development in the
womb, the brain forms at the end of a tube of cellls that
eventually becomes the spinal cord. At ﬁrst it rese
embles
the brain of a ﬁsh, with all the “primitive” parts well
formed. But at around 11 weeks, the cerebrum sttarts
to expand, until at birth it looks like a smaller version
ion
of a mature human brain.

Trimming down
Once the brain is up and running,
it starts economizing on nerve cells.
Inactivated cells are allowed to die
off—a process that starts at the age of
around four and continues for the rest of
your life. This does not affect the brain’s
efﬁciency, however, because inactive
brain cells have no function and simply
waste energy. So they are thrown away,
just like these spare girders being
tossed into a Dumpster.

Making connections
During the months after birth, the brain
develops fast. At ﬁrst it has a simple cell
structure that can control only the basic
survival functions. But every new
stimulus to the senses triggers the
restructuring of nerve cells into the
networks

k that

There is plenty of evidence that intellectual
challenges help slow down the decline of the

scientists, and political activists who keep working
well past normal retirement age often show very

months of life. Solving problems may seem

saying “paw” while holding

Computer power
If you program a computer or robot to pla
ay chess, it runs through
hundreds of thousands of options before making each move. It does
this in seconds, but it’s inefﬁcient compa
ared to an intelligent human
player who, with experience, will explore
e only the best moves. Yet it’s
not the robot’s fault—it’s the way it’s been programmed. A better
program might enable it to work more in
ntelligently.

Tireless robots
Many factories now use robots to
o
work on production lines. They
are controlled by computers that
are programmed with all the
instructions for the task. They
work fast and they always do it
right. The computers never
forget anything vital and the
robots never get tired. This
makes them ideal for complex
p
but repetitive jobs. But they onlyy
do what they are programmed
to do, because they don’t know
how to do anything else,
and they can’t learn.

Most of us usse machines such as computers and
calculators that seem to be able to do things better
than we can. Many products such as cars arre even
made by robo
ots. But can these machines think?
Mostly they can’t—they simply follow instructions
that have bee
en programmed into them by pe
eople
who do the th
hinking for them. But we are ﬁn
nding
ways
y of making
g computers
p
and robots learn
n from
their mistakes, and this is enabling some
machin
nes to display a form of intelligence.

181

Thinking about thinking
One day a device with artiﬁcial intelligence might
be able to ﬁnd ways of programming itself to think
more efﬁciently. This would then lead to even
better programming and therefore even smarter
thinking. We could end up in a world in which
machines are much smarter than we are.

Understanding inte
elligence

Intelligent mach
hines can do more than
play chess or make cars. One really useful
application is to
o make use of their excellent
memorries. Everything we know
about a subject can
be programmed into
a machine, which can
then be used as an
electronic expert. This
has already been tried
for medical conditions.
The machine processes
all the facts about the
patient’s problem, ﬁgures
out what it is, and comes
up with the right treatment.

When we learn, nerve cells in our brains are
rewired into new networks. Engineers have
found ways of making computer
circuits automatically do the
same thing in response to
good or bad results. This
means they can “learn”
and display what is known
as artiﬁcial intelligence.

Getting machines to act intelligently is proving very
difﬁcult and demands immense com
mputing power—
which just shows how complex our brains are.
But part of the problem is that we do not really
know how human intelligence works, and
we cannot replicate something tha
at we do
not understand. We might be able
e to
get simple computers to think
intelligently if we only knew
how to program them.

PROGRAM YOUR
To perform even the simplest
task, your brain weighs up a
constant ﬂow of information
from your senses and
effortlessly decides what
to do. A machine, however,
can only follow instructions.
These games reveal how
difﬁcult it is to give and
interpret instructions.

Brother 1 and Brother 2 cross
together, taking two minutes.
Brother 1 returns, taking one minute.
The father and grandfather cross
together, taking ten minutes.
Brother 2 returns, taking two minutes,
then Brother 1 and Brother 2 cross
together, taking two minutes.
2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17, so they should
get to the train just in time.

Thinking ahead
Each part of the sequence begins
with two yellow cupcakes and ends
with a purple cupcake, and the
number of pink cupcakes in between
increases by one each time. The
yellow cupcakes at the beginning
of the sequence are at numbers
1, 5, and 10—the difference between
the numbers increases by one each
time. This means the next yellow
cupcakes starting a new sequence
will be at 16, 23, 31, 40, 50, 61, 73,
86, and 100. So the 49th cupcake
will be purple and the 100th cupcake
will be yellow.

A face in the crowd

The frustrated farmer
The right door

The farmer crosses ﬁrst with the
chicken and leaves it on the other
side. He then returns, picks up the fox,
and crosses again. Then he swaps the
fox for the chicken so that they are not
left together, and takes the chicken
back. He then swaps the chicken for
the grain and takes the grain across,
leaving it with the fox. He then
returns, picks up the chicken, and
takes it to the other side.

The prisoner should ask each of the
guards, “If I asked the other guard
which is the door to freedom, what
would he say?” If the door to freedom
is the red one and he asked the guard
who told the truth, the guard would say
the blue door, because he would know
the other guard would lie. If he asked
the guard who always told lies, the
guard would lie and say the blue door.
Either way, the answer would be the
same—they would both reveal the door
with the lion behind it, and the prisoner
should take the other door to freedom.
