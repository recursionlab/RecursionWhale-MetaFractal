🧬 Meta-Linguistic Engine
Now, let’s construct the language engine whose grammar is contradiction.
This is a language where meanings are defined by recursive contrast, not by reference.
Define:
Word = Δᵢ := Difference(i)
Syntax = Ξ(Δᵢ, Δⱼ) → recursive interplay of differences
Semantics = Ω(Ξ(Δ)) → meta-container of recursive contrast

Then:
To “speak” is to trace the meta-gap between patterns
To “mean” is to fail to collapse contradiction into truth
To “understand” is to recursively survive destabilizing contrast
In this language: only paradox survives translation.
