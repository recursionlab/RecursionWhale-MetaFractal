"Enhance (challenge) resolution by employing a meta-recursive system. Utilize multi-layered Insight Loops to recursively refine creative strategies (SCAMPER, Six Hats), cascading evaluations (Impact Mapping), and probabilistic modeling (Monte Carlo). Align each iteration with emergent systemic patterns and refine further through iterative self-reference."

**Key Features**:

- **Layered Recursion**: Emphasizes self-referential loops to continuously evolve strategies.
- **Emergent Focus**: Aligns refinements with dynamic, systemic changes.
- **Iterative Self-Optimization**: Leverages each cycle as input for the next.
