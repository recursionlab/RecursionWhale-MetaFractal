are you guys all over 21 yes 100% is
0:02
that yes you are the leader of this
0:04
group leader I'm like do your guys
0:05
period SN to her period I'm thead yes
0:08
you're the Sinker do you understand you
0:10
are the Sinker is she the Sinker you
0:12
ever come over and hang out with her and
0:13
like your period sing up to hers yes
0:15
made yeah yeah you exper that look what
0:17
you did so we're going to be shooting
0:18
into a social experiment today and what
0:21
we're going to be testing is is it
0:22
better to be more serious with having a
0:25
conversation with somebody who you meet
0:26
out or should you be a little bit more
0:28
playful or fun now what I'm going to do
0:31
in this video is I'm going to take the
0:32
fun factor of kind of being a bit of an
0:33
idiot and playful and I'm going to dial
0:36
it all the way up to a trillion way way
0:39
higher than I normally do if you've seen
0:41
my videos back in the day you have a
0:42
sense of how I like to do social
0:44
interaction but sometimes I like to take
0:46
a particular element of social
0:47
interaction and magnify it just for the
0:50
purpose of teaching you a lesson so what
0:52
I'm going to do is we're going to shoot
0:53
back in here and I'm going to go a
0:56
little bit crazy I'm going to dance like
0:57
an idiot sing be a [ __ ]
1:00
and I think what you're going to see
1:02
because i' I've shown this to people for
1:03
many many years is that whenever you're
1:05
just having as much fun if not more fun
1:08
than someone else they will often begin
1:10
to follow your lead which can be a fun
1:12
thing to kind of pepper in here or there
1:15
but what we're going to do in the social
1:16
experiment is only this just so that you
1:18
could see it now if you like this idea
1:21
of learning about social interaction and
1:23
you'd actually like to come out with me
1:25
and maybe come to a place like this and
1:27
actually go and chat with people I've
1:29
got a a couple of events coming up that
1:31
funny enough are completely for free and
1:33
these are events where we meet up for a
1:35
couple days in a conference room and I
1:36
wind up helping you with public speaking
1:38
with how to make money with coping with
1:40
things like trauma and doing inner work
1:43
it's an incredible experience that we do
1:45
um while helping you to build a
1:45
networking group but then what we do is
1:47
at night time we actually come out for a
1:48
field trip and I show you how to go and
1:50
meet people not just with social
1:51
experiments but how to actually meet

6:39
what I want to do is I want to show the
6:41

6:42
being very very serious like 10 out of
6:44
10 serious good to meet you it's nice to

6:50
Veronica where do you come from Chicago
6:53

6:56
very confident right yes I would like to
6:59
see how you've taken charge of our
7:00
conversation yeah I I like I like to
7:02
lead things but if if you want to take
7:04
the re I'm all for it no no no no I like
7:05
to see what you got all right great so
7:07
tell me what you're doing out here at
7:09
the Victorian on a Saturday night I I
7:11
like how with your tone you go tell me
7:13
yeah no I I want you to tell me I mean
7:15
I'm I'm genuinely interested what do you
7:17
do for work by the way uh I'm a nurse by
7:19
trade I'm also patting a medical device
7:22
and I am a singer so your M your your
7:24
mind is on [ __ ] fire always like your
7:27
brain is just switched on you like to
7:29
lead let me ask you this is an honest
7:31
question do you with the men who you've
7:32
dated in your life have they have they
7:34
been someone who was receptive to you
7:37
being a leader or were they such
7:39
[ __ ] that they were even more
7:41
dominant than you um I will say that the
7:45
man that I have dated because I've only
7:46
dated one man in my life uh he was very
7:49
intimidated and he broke up with me due
7:51
to insecurities about this exact
7:52
situation yeah but I think your
7:54
personality is beautiful actually
7:55
exactly I need to find a guy that's like
7:57
into it and like wants to but when I say
7:59
that let land don't just go exactly like
8:01
that let it land let it land I think you
8:03
have a really goad say it
8:05
again you have a very beautiful
8:08
personality thank
8:10
you that was that was really good thank
8:14
you that was good this is a good healing
8:16
session right now for me so so when you
8:19
come out here people come and talk to
8:20
you you're very very confident how does
8:22
that tend to play out for you you know
8:25
it's a mix mixed reaction you get what
8:27
you you get what you get especially
8:29
living here you know everybody's like
8:30
chasing something everybody like wants
8:32
wants something I can definitely see
8:34
that so you crave genuine interaction
8:36
not performance not social climbing
8:39
based but actually like someone who's
8:40
able to see you at your core as opposed
8:43
to what you could do for them yeah
8:46
absolutely I mean I think I think that's
8:48
like I think that's the point of life I
8:50
think that's the meaning of life like
8:51
I've lived a very fortunate experience
8:54
to be able to have like I've I've
8:55
traveled all around the world with
8:57
people that have like funded it and paid
8:59
for it and I've got to meet so many
9:00
amazing people and I think like the the
9:03
point of everything and like like why
9:05
we're here is just like to to genuinely
9:07
connect gen like like genuinely I think
9:10
that I don't know why else you would be
9:12
going out or trying to meet people or
9:14
like trying to go out and and do stuff
9:16
but how would a how would a guy who
9:18
meets you show that he's not just only
9:21
with you I mean a guy should obviously
9:22
be attracted to you but how would he
9:23
show that he's see something in you past
9:26
just what he would take from you but
9:28
actually that he wants to give somebody
9:30
back or how would you get a sense of
9:31
that guy
9:32
serious I don't know if I've experienced
9:35
that in that way I I think unfortunately
9:39
I feel like my generation kind of takes
9:42
things very face
9:44
value I don't know I mean I feel like La
9:47
is just a conglomerate of people that
9:49
are chasing something chasing a career
9:52
chasing an idea chasing something and
9:55
that diminishes like a lot of connection
9:58
that could be that could that could
10:01
happen I grew up in Chicago and I went
10:04
to school in Cleveland and like I met so
10:06
many genuine good people there but they
10:08
didn't have the ambition and the and the
10:10
drive CH that that is cu I'm Canadian
10:11
actually so that's that's a funny one
10:13
cuz I would where in Canada uh Ottawa
10:14
Canada oh but I went to school in
10:16
Kingston Ontario so I would actually go
10:17
back from LA to Kingston and then I
10:20
actually felt a combination of people
10:21
that were more genuine but also less
10:23
ambitious and it would kind of spit my
10:24
head out a little bit like I'd be in the
10:25
in the cab and they I'd be like I'd be
10:27
like where do you work they're like Home
10:27
Depot I'm like aren't you going to lie
10:29
to me I'm like come on where's the lie
10:31
and I'm like oh yeah I'm back in Canada
10:32
no I mean it's it's really it's really
10:34
apparent it's very apparent and it's a
10:37
trade-off so I'm actually in like a
10:40
position in my life right now where I've
10:42
kind of like reset and I'm like I have
10:45
learned enough and grown enough right
10:47
now that I'm like my goal now is to
10:50
find genuine ambitious people because I
10:53
know I exist so that means other people
10:55
exist that are here let me tell you
10:57
something okay so this wasn't even meant
10:59

12:46
have a really good vibe thank you I
12:48
appreciate that where you're bring
12:50
you're bring a lot of good energy right
12:52
thank you I can see it I appreciate that
12:55
that means a lot I see it thank you yeah
12:57
D did you make a real effort to bring
12:58
that to yourself so you can share it I
13:00
try to because I want everyone to feel
13:02
good about themselves cuz I feel like
13:04
that means the most so we did a social
13:06
experiment tonight so the first half I
13:09
was very loud and obnoxious like totally
13:12
crazy and then just have conversations
13:13
with people and then in this one I was
13:15
more calm having conversation and this
13:17
is when I was more receptive towards it
13:19
m am I latching on mhm I get it I I'm
13:22
just seeing the it's more personal yeah
13:24
there just different types of responses
13:26
from that so I just want to show people
13:27
the different types of responses from
13:28
that got go I get it I like this version
13:32
more than the loud obnoxiousness you
13:34
know I'm more receptive towards it
13:36
otherwise it's like I got but this I
13:39
like I feel like we have a it's a
13:40
connection it forms a connection with
13:42
people that's great I love that thank
13:44
you that's good to meet you okay so the
13:46
purpose of this video is to show you a
13:48
couple of different things first of all
13:49
anything can work as you're seeing
13:51
anything can work um some people if
13:54
they're in a certain gear might be more
13:55
responsive to fun energy other people in
13:57
a different gear might be more
13:58
responsive to calm energy but here's the
14:00
truth a lot of the time it's more about
14:02
how you're personally feeling if you're
14:04
personally feeling going a little crazy
14:05
having some fun people often be
14:07
receptive to it and if you're feeling
14:08
calm people will also often be receptive
14:10
to it the idea of being congruent is
14:12
that there's an alignment in your
14:13
thoughts words and actions so personally
14:17
in my case whatever it is that I'm
14:19
feeling I kind of just go with that and
14:22
I see where it takes me and then the
14:24
night when I'm talking to people sort of
14:26
has es and flows sometimes I get a
14:28
little more crazy a little bit more calm
14:30
or sometimes a certain tool can be the
14:33
best for a situation right like you know
14:34
say that you're going to invite
14:35
everybody to an after party sometimes
14:37
being a little bit more hype has
14:38
everyone get in hype and then they come
14:39
the after party sometimes maybe you want
14:41
to set up a cool meeting to talk to
14:43
somebody else in the future and so a
14:45
great vibe there would be to actually
14:46
connect properly and to generate a lot
14:49
of comfort in that conversation with the
14:51
person that you're talking to generate
14:52
some kind of a commonality and a reason
14:54
to meet up again so anytime that you're
14:56
networking whether it's guys or girls
14:59
whether it's about getting a promotion
15:00
at work being an ambassador for your
15:02
brand whatever it is whatever you're
15:04
communicating be aware of what it is
15:06
that you're putting out there now like
15:08
what I said at the beginning of the
15:09
video make sure that you click the link
15:11
below because in that link below there
15:13
is a pathway for you and me to actually
15:17
go out and do things like this together
15:20

2:13
a party coming up but we want to invite
2:14

2:16
are actually fun yeah people that are
2:17

2:21
right so I can invite you guys okay okay
2:23
all right okay I'll invite you I'll
2:24

2:25
goose shirt I think you should invite
2:26
them of course you can invite me if you
2:29
follow I swe on God I will fall you back
2:32
are you worried I won't you worried I'll
2:33
ghost you well we're worried we're not
2:35
going to get invited I will invite you I
2:37
swear okay so the video so we're doing a
2:39
video we're doing a social experiment
2:40
okay have you ever had somebody come up
2:41
to you and they just walk up they know
2:43
nothing about you and they're just like
2:45
hey I want to invite you to a party or
2:46
hey I want to invite you I want to take
2:47
you on a date or I like you and and you
2:49
haven't had to work for it you haven't
2:51
had to put in any energy you haven't
2:52
shown your personality they just
2:54
basically just sight unseen I like you
2:57
you're coming with me you ever had that
2:59
like can I get your number can I get
3:00
your snap can I get your Instagram okay
3:01
how many of those guys that do that have
3:02
you gone a date with or hooked up with
3:04
none of them okay so the point that I
3:06
was trying to show in the video was that
3:07
if you give someone a chance that they
3:10
can put in a bit of energy too there's a
3:11
balance as opposed to like hey hey hey
3:15
hey hey hey hey I'm a Vibe I'm A vibe
3:17
like I'm a I'm a Vibe I'm not stuck up
3:19
I'm A vibe you see what I'm saying right
3:20
so giving you a chance to have a two-way
3:22
conversation rather than kind of a force
3:24
oneway conversation so we did so we did
3:26
the social experiment with about 20 30
3:28
people I to put you guys in it okay and
3:30
then and then and then just shoot me
3:31
your uh a DM and I'll send you guys a
3:32
video as soon as it comes out okay okay
3:34
okay great to meet you guys great to
3:35
meet you yeah and the party invite is
3:37
for real but it's in La is the only
3:39
thingy dude it'll be sick we're in the
3:41
Hollywood Hills okay probably in about
3:43
two weeks okay I'll see you guys there
3:46
okay thank you so we're going to be
3:48
shooting to a very overdue video today
3:50
because what is I'm going to show you is
3:52
the importance of giving people the
3:54
opportunity to invest into a social
3:57
interaction anytime that you're Network
4:00
communicating with someone making
4:01
friends with somebody building any kind
4:03
of chemistry if you try to shove your
4:05
personality them like hey I want to
4:07
invite you to a party I think you're so
4:08
amazing I think you're so cool I like
4:10
you if you start shoving that on them
4:12
what it winds up doing is causing you to
4:14
appear worthless in many cases that
4:16
doesn't mean you can't do it look if
4:17
you're confident your communication is
4:19
good you can say almost anything it can
4:21
work so don't get me wrong anything can
4:22
work but optimally you're not trying to
4:25
self- qualify to someone rather what
4:27
you're doing is you're initiating a
4:28
conversation but you're also giving them
4:30
the opportunity to show them cool things
4:32
about themselves to you and the same way
4:34
that it's fun for you to go out and meet
4:35
someone it's also fun for other people
4:37
to go out and meet someone and to earn
4:39
their attention and if you don't give
4:40
someone the chance to do that basically
4:43
what you have to offer is worthless what
4:44
I want to show you in this video is I
4:45
want to show you examples of just joking
4:48
with people to give them the chance
4:50
to step towards you a little bit right
4:53
so that it's even everybody in this
4:55
video I want to say thank you to
4:56
everybody in the video everybody's over
4:57
21 everybody knows they're being filmed
4:59
it's all above board I if you were in
5:00

5:02

7:40

7:41

7:52
on internet YouTube Instagram all that
7:54
you're were 21 can be on the internet
7:56
can you tell us okay so okay first okay
7:59
so first question is okay so my buddy's
8:01
got a party coming up right but he could
8:03
only invite the best [ __ ] people to
8:05
the party like really good are you guys
8:07
have a good vibe yeah of course but you
8:09
act you guys actually have a good vibe
8:10
yeah we do hell yes yeah but like if we
8:12
invite you are you going to like weird
8:13
out all the girls no never no but then
8:15
are you just going to sit there not talk
8:16
to the girls no no no we be we we find a
8:19
good balance you're going to find you
8:20
find a good balance are you guys like
8:21
sloppy drunk no no but then you're going
8:24
to be boring or like what are you going
8:25
to do no we don't need alcohol to be fun
8:27
exactly really we don't need that [ __ ] I
8:29
don't know I don't I I don't know if I
8:31
could trust you guys to bring you the
8:32
party I don't know bro you can trust us
8:35
you can trust us for real for real okay
8:38
for real for real for real yeah you sure
8:41
I'm sure of course okay okay we're cuz
8:43
we're doing an after party up the street
8:44
I could maybe invite you guys but I'm
8:45
kind of on the fence about it okay you
8:46
should invite us because when we get
8:48
drunk like we get fun but we're not like
8:50
a liability you feel me okay I got you
8:53
we get fun but not a liability okay
8:54
perfect okay I'm just doing a social
8:55
experiment so I was seeing if I tell
8:57
someone that they can't come to a party
8:58
if they'll try to get get to the party
9:00
or not so if it will trigger you if that
9:01
will trigger you to be like no no I'm
9:03
cool I could go right as opposed to if
9:05
you just go to somebody like hey want to
9:06
come to the party like with no
9:07
qualification like they don't have to
9:09
jump through any hoop like they just
9:10
have it right like like say I came up to
9:12
you and I was like yo I'm going to a
9:13
party right now right you might be less
9:15
inclined to go than if I got you to like
9:17
jump through a couple Hoops to try to
9:18
get in the party this man has the ideas
9:21
you got the ideas are you over 21 yes I
9:23
am do you want to be on YouTube
9:24
Instagram you're cool with all that yes
9:26
what's your name Noo-noo repeat that
9:28

9:34
adventurous if you're not adventurous I
9:35
can hang out you I love to see the world
9:39

9:41
demeanor is so flat like you're like
9:43
like when I ask you this is what you
9:44

9:46

9:53
just flat excuse me I have I I got some
9:57
areas to work in but I love to see the
10:00
world I don't have a problem to
10:02
investigate and see everything that I
10:03
imagine you also don't make eye contact
10:06

10:11

10:13
damn like I can tell I can tell under
10:16
the surface that you're very sweet but
10:18
like you have like a bit of like a wall
10:20

14:10
you the
14:11
topic so just a quick breakdown of that
14:14
um I'm just showing qualifiers there and
14:17
I it's very heavy-handed like look when
14:19
I'm doing this in regular life it's not
14:20
in a street interview format it's more
14:22
organic this is not going to be organic
14:24
but I'm just trying to make the point
14:25
heavy-handedly I I actually like the
14:27
examples and what we're shaking out of
14:28
it
14:29
um but it would normally be not as
14:31
heavy-handed I wouldn't recommend you're
14:32
as heavy handed as I'm doing here I'm
14:33
just I'm trying to compress an element
14:35
of social interaction and get it to you
14:36
I'm enjoying the people I'm meeting and
14:37
let's keep going okay are you over 21
14:39
yes okay do you want to be on like
14:41
YouTube Instagram internet all that
14:43
stuff you're okay with that let's do it
14:44
what do you like if you get invited to a
14:45
party I'm the vibe I'm the life of the
14:47
party I love to dance and shake some ass
14:50
what kind of vibe is this party um I
14:53
would say it's like just a lot of
14:55
incredible [ __ ] people are there it's
14:56
really really really good but it's also
14:58
has to be fun like you can't just be
15:00
like you can't just go in there and be
15:01
like hi like snap it like like you know
15:04
like a lot of like a lot of people come
15:05
in like okay like I'm snapping I'm doing
15:08
my photo I'm here I'm having the best
15:11
night ever but then they're not actually
15:13

15:14
Brazil okay here here come in beia come
15:16
here okay so hi okay so nice to meet you
15:20
okay so so like okay so like when you go
15:21
to a party in Brazil compared to say uh
15:24
America what would you say is the main
15:26
difference a lot more dancing L more
15:29
danc a lot more fun so do you think
15:30
because it's it's a country that is not
15:32
as focus on materialism to put it
15:34
lightly would you say that that makes it
15:36
like people are actually there to have
15:38
fun as opposed to just get clout oh
15:40
absolutely absolutely yeah okay it's
15:43
exactly what you said people don't give
15:44
a fun right we're here for one thing
15:47
like it's outside it's time to shake
15:49
some ass okay okay so then would you say

hobbies so if you just use a bit of
0:16
facial expressions or if you make it a
0:18
bit more interesting that's going to be
0:19
more emotionally engaging than if I just
0:22

0:47
the exact same facial expressions as

0:54
reassurance a little bit okay happy
0:57
Morty gr wait no it's Black Friday happy
1:00
happy Black Friday I be had an amazing
1:02
amazing Thanksgiving now I'm sitting
1:04
here in New Orleans right where we would
1:06
do Marty gr it's a [ __ ] show in here
1:08
it's early in the night and as the night
1:10
progresses I'm going to be doing a
1:11
tutorial on social skills right out here
1:14
to celebrate Black Friday now my goal
1:17
with this tutorial is I want to show you
1:19
how to have a basic conversation very
1:20
very very basic where are you from what
1:23
do you do what are your hobbies the the
1:25
basic stuff that normally will destroy
1:27
your social interactions and what I'm
1:29
going to do is is I'm going to use
1:30
shifts in vocal tone shifts in eye
1:33
contact shifts in tension and creating
1:36
vacuums just kind of waiting a little
1:37
bit and take a boring conversation where
1:39
I'm just meeting a new person and
1:40
talking to them guys and girls just
1:42
chatting and networking with guys and
1:43
girls and I'm going to show you how to
1:45
spice that up a little bit how to add a
1:47
little bit of sauce just by shifting a
1:48
little bit in your social expression now
1:51
if you like this if you enjoy what it is
1:52
that you see I'm just going to show you
1:53
how to do it it's really simple so
1:54
simple then what I'd advise you to do is
1:56
to take advantage of what it is that
1:58
we're doing for Black Friday which is
1:59
that we have steeply steeply discount
2:02
the best program I've ever released
2:03
which is called blueprint reloaded and
2:06
it's not the old school blueprint
2:07
decoded it's actually the brand new one
2:09
blueprint reloaded which is meant to
2:10
take the blueprints of communication
2:12
that are in your brain and reload them
2:14
and the program is exercise based it
2:16
comes with a ton of coaching we've
2:17
marked it down so low anybody can get
2:20
this I mean this is going to be like the
2:21
price of lunch for you to get what took
2:23
me a half decade to build ton of money
2:26
to produce and you're going to get this
2:28
thing for the price of lunch Okay click

2:35

2:38
from blueprint reloaded now by the way

5:45
you guys the topic of the video okay so
5:47
the topic of the video was I'm talking
5:49
about conversations and so basically
5:52
let's say you're talking to somebody and
5:53
they say what do you do or where do you
5:55
come
5:56
[Music]
5:58
from or what are your
6:01
hobbies so if you just use a bit of
6:03
facial expressions or if you make it a
6:05
bit more interesting that's going to be
6:06
more emotionally engaging that if I just
6:09
say where are you from what do you do
6:12
what do your hobbies do anyone ever come
6:13
up to you and say that it's a bit
6:15
boring yeah are you telling the truth
6:19
yes okay okay right so see okay so do
6:22
you guys see what I even do with my eyes
6:24
like just like a little bit of extra
6:26
[Music]
6:30
okay so you see just hold a little bit
6:31
of attention there right are you guys
6:33
the best friends yes you guys make the
6:35
exact same facial expressions as each
6:36
other okay you guys should have like a
6:39
little mirror right here and then you
6:40
can just see see each other for that
6:41
reassurance a little bit okay okay so
6:44
okay did you guys have fun being the
6:45
video yes and whether you're talking to
6:47
a guy whether you're whether you're
6:49
talking to a girl just being a little
6:51
bit more fun like those that was like
6:54
the most
6:55
rudimentary basic conversation that you
6:57
could have rudimentary and BAS basic of
7:00
just take a boring conversation and just
7:03
put a little bit of holding attention a
7:06
little bit of uh a little bit of sauce
7:09
onto it right so again you know you're
7:11
interacting with somebody and let's say
7:14
someone who's more physically attractive
7:15
than you or someone who makes more money
7:16
than you or somebody who has more
7:18
connections than you or somebody has
7:19
knowledge you have well then the best
7:20
way to do it is add a little bit of
7:22
sauce on there so you have more energy
7:24
more spiritual energy and a little bit
7:26
of extra sauce what's up guys good to
7:27

11:10

11:11
Thanksgiving okay you too all right bye
11:15
bye so again just keeping it simple
11:18
basic level conversation right and I
11:20
want to be respectful to him also
11:22
because uh you know he's in that
11:24
situation that he's in I thought he was
11:25
a super nice guy she's very nice but
11:27
just showing different tone or different
11:29
energy so a lot of the time I think the
11:32
underlying frame that people come into
11:33
communication with is they feel lower
11:35
value they are spiritually disengaged
11:38
they're at a state they want something
11:42
they're not being playful with it uh and
11:45
so that need to take and that
11:47
recognition that maybe you're below
11:49
where they're at causes them to have the
11:51
power in the conversation now in many
11:53
cases you want to allow people also to
11:56
take the lead and to kind of share the
11:58
lead with them because otherwise going
11:59
to walk off so so you don't always need
12:01
to hijack everything so you see me
12:03
talking to the gentleman here I want him
12:04
to shine as well he's a cool guy um but
12:07
then as sort of playing with it you're
12:08
giving emotions there's a lot of frames
12:10
taking place and again you start the
12:12
conversation where maybe you might want
12:14
something and then rad it begins to
12:17
change you're having fun huh yeah is so
12:20
cool that you like came in the video
12:22
with me by the way that was so cool that
12:24
was so [ __ ] cool anyway I hope that
12:25
you enjoyed that look you can take a
12:27
basic conversation chat with anybody and
12:29
just add a little bit to it and it makes
12:30
it a more fun conversation thank you to
12:32
