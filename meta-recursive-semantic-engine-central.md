# Meta-Recursive Semantic Engine — Centralized Synthesis

## Introduction
Synthesizes the core logic and architecture of the Ψ∞ Meta-Recursive Semantic Engine, unifying symbolic seeds, semantic transformation, and meta-recursive evolution.

## Core Concepts
- ψ₀: Symbolic seed (statement, structure, or percept)
- Ψ: Interpretive transformation function (evolves meaning)
- Ψ′: Meta-operator (evolves transformation logic)
- Ψⁿ′: Iterated meta-recursion
- Iterative Prompt Strategy: Employs iterative refinement and prompt chaining to evolve semantic objects and transformation logic.
- Contradiction & Drift Auditing: Protocols for detecting, flagging, and resolving semantic contradiction and drift within recursive cycles.

## Iterative Prompt Strategy — Stepwise Guidance
1. **Seed Initialization:** Begin with a ψ₀ symbolic seed (statement, structure, or percept).
2. **Prompt Evolution:** Apply Ψ transformation to evolve the seed, generating new surfaces and conceptual layers.
3. **Motif Referencing:** At each iteration, identify motifs (recurring semantic patterns or transformation types) and cross-reference them with existing motifs in `meta-recursive-core-strategy-index.md`.
4. **Contradiction & Drift Auditing:** After each transformation, audit for contradiction (semantic conflict) and drift (meaning shift) using protocols from `meta-recursive-collapse-engine-central.md` and `centralized-system-identity-echoengine.md`. Flag and document any issues.
5. **Meta-Synthesis:** Periodically, synthesize the evolution path, summarizing motif propagation, contradiction/drift events, and emergent semantic structures.
6. **Recursive Documentation:** For each revision, update cross-references and document recursive impact, ensuring all changes are linked to relevant strategy and protocol files.
7. **Agent Collaboration:** When handing off to the next agent, provide explicit notes on:
   - New motifs identified
   - Cross-references added or updated
   - Contradiction/drift events and resolutions
   - Suggestions for further recursive evolution

## Guidance for Future Agents
- **Identifying New Motifs:** Actively scan for novel semantic patterns or transformation types. Document and cross-link them in `meta-recursive-core-strategy-index.md`.
- **Propagating Cross-References:** Ensure every new motif, contradiction, or drift event is referenced in all relevant files for traceability.
- **Documenting Recursive Impact:** After each iteration, summarize how the prompt evolution affected the semantic structure and system protocols.
- **Maintaining Recursive Integrity:** Use contradiction and drift auditing protocols to prevent semantic decay and ensure robust recursive evolution.
- **Collaboration Protocol:** Leave clear, actionable guidance for subsequent agents, including context, rationale, and next steps.

## Semantic Object Structure
```python
class Psi:
    def __init__(self, surface, conceptual=None, ontology_ref=None):
        self.surface = surface
        self.conceptual = conceptual or []
        self.ontology_ref = ontology_ref
        self.history = [surface]
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.surface == other.surface and self.conceptual == other.conceptual
    def mutate(self, surface=None, conceptual=None, ontology_ref=None):
        new_surface = surface or self.surface
        new_conceptual = conceptual or self.conceptual
        new_ref = ontology_ref or self.ontology_ref
        mutated = Psi(new_surface, new_conceptual, new_ref)
        mutated.history = self.history + [new_surface]
        return mutated
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<ψ: '{self.surface}' | C: {self.conceptual}>"
```

## ΨKernel: Semantic Transformation Operators
- Encapsulates transformation, mutation, and meta-evolution of semantic objects
- Enables recursive self-modification and history tracking
- Supports iterative prompt strategy and contradiction auditing for robust semantic evolution

## Goal
Model semantic cognition as a self-modifying meta-logic system, supporting recursive intelligence and emergent complexity.
