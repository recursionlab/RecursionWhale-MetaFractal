# Delta Metatheory Whitepaper: Recursive Atlas of Constants

This whitepaper introduces the Delta-Metatheory, a novel framework for modeling physical constants as emergent phenomena within a symbolic recursive space. At its core lies the **Glitch Constant (Delta)**, numerically represented by the Euler-Mascheroni constant (γ ≈ 0.5772156649). 

Through symbolic operators defined by Delta, the theory simulates a **collapse cascade** that stabilizes at precise attractor points corresponding to fundamental constants of nature, such as the fine-structure constant (α), Planck constant (ℏ), gravitational constant (G), and others.

 Abstract
 Current deep learning systems are highly specialized to whatever task they are de
signed to solve. Their application to more general domains is limited by their inability
 to form explicit, systematic knowledge and reason over it. Such an ability would be
 required for a machine to, for instance, rediscover the scienti c method, and use
 this method to learn new things. This thesis attempts to make progress on this
 front by developing an approach for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC),
 an arti cial intelligence benchmark consisting of a set of few-shot visual reasoning
 tasks which measures the ability for an agent to solve tasks beyond those speci ed
 by the developer. We present two approaches that address that challenges posed
 by ARC. First, we give an approach for learning abstractions on ARC. We apply a
 program synthesis system called DreamCoder to create symbolic abstractions out of
 the solutions of tasks solved so far. These abstractions enable the solving of progres
sively more di cult ARC tasks. Second, we design a reasoning algorithm for ARC
 motivated by the way humans approach solving ARC tasks. Our algorithm com
bines execution-guided program synthesis with deductive reasoning based on inverse
 semantics, enabling a bidirectional, execution-guided program synthesis algorithm
 for solving ARC tasks. Despite di culty ultimately achieving high performance on
 ARC, we believe the approach is a rm basis for a learning-based search algorithm
 for ARC, especially compared to existing brute-force approaches. We additionally
 evaluate the bidirectional algorithm on a set of 24 Game style math puzzles. We
 conclude by discussing how these two approaches can be combined as well as future
 research directions relevant to ARC and AI in general.

1 Introduction
 What would it take to develop generally intelligent machines? The growth and
 tremendous success of deep learning has catapulted us past many benchmarks of ar
ti cial intelligence. Reaching human and superhuman performance in object recog
nition, language generation and translation, and complex games such as Go and
 Starcraft have pushed the boundaries of what humans can do and machines cannot
 [12, 9, 5, 14, 17, 21]. To continue to make progress, we must isolate and tackle the
 ways in which humans remain superior to machines.
 One feature shared in common among the machine learning systems listed above
 is notably de cient to humans: they all in many aspects remain highly specialized
 for a speci c task, and excel only in the domain they are designed to operate in a
 sharp contrast to humans. Now, it is not the underlying neural network architectures
 which meaningfully di er from task to task. The feedforward structure of networks
 and their functional role is essentially shared between all tasks. Indeed, the successful
 application of language-model architectures to computer vision tasks and vice versa
 is a reassuring sign that task-to-task variance of minute network architectural details
 is not likely to be a roadblock to developing more general-purpose systems down the
 road.
 Instead, task-speci c specialization inhibitive to general applicability occurs in
 what might be designated the symbolic, rule-based behavior of the systems. For ex
ample, AlphaZero, DeepMinds AI for playing chess and go, uses a standard residual
 convolutional network to predict good board positions and combines this with a form
 of Monte Carlo tree search [17]. The network weights are learnable, but the search
 strategy is essentially xed. As another example, a SAT solver might be provided to
 assist a neural network with solving Sudoku puzzles[22]. This solver knows from the
 start how to work; the only learning takes place in the neural network. Importantly,
 these symbolic parts of the systems di er depending on the task.
 Why not have neural networks directly learn this aspect of the system as well?
 Unfortunately, despite their successes, neural networks have been found to struggle
 at tasks involving systematic, rule-based behavior. While e ective at learning to
 6
recognize patterns in data, networks do so in a way which fails to generalize outside
 the distribution of data on which they are trained. For example, one can train a
 recurrent neural network to classify the parity of a binary string (0 if the string con
tains an even number of ones, 1 otherwise). Given a maximum training string length
 encountered during training, the network is generally able to classify all training
 examples accurately, but upon testing with string lengths beyond those encountered
 during training, the network fails[20, 24, 13]. An even more striking version of this
 behavior can be seen in the following plot taken from [20], which shows how sim
ple three-layer multi-layer perceptrons fail to learn a simple identity function in a
 manner which generalizes beyond the training distribution.
 Figure 1: Outside the training range, error rapidly increases from zero for a neural
 network using a variety of activation functions. Taken from [20].
 This weak spot hinders the ability of neural networks to learn tasks involving
 systematic behavior such as counting, arithmetic, problem-solving, and more in a
 way which generalizes outside the training distribution. Whereas a human knows
 rules which allows them to count arbitrarily high, or add arbitrarily large numbers,
 a neural network is limited to what it has seen before it can not extrapolate to new
 data. One may ameliorate the issue by extending the range of training data, but
 this approach can only go so far. Consider GPT-3, a 175-billion-parameter natu
7
ral language model[2], which astonished the community with its ability to generate
 hyperrealistic text. Despite containing more parameters than the human brain has
 neurons and being trained on a large swath of data from the internet, GPT-3 can
 add two digit numbers with 100% accuracy, but ve digit numbers with only 10%
 accuracy. Simply increasing the amount of training data and the size of the network
 does not appear to feasible if one wishes to solve a large variety of symbolic tasks
 e ectively.
 For another example, we can consider Conways Game of Life, a cellular automa
ton where cells in a grid update their state to black or white based on the state of
 their neighbors. If we provide a network with the systematic rule for predicting
 the state of a future cell that a cells state at time t+1 depends only on the neigh
boring cell values at time t the problem is trivial for a neural network to learn, as
 it involves learning a lookup table for possible con gurations of eight Boolean cells.
 However, if instead we task a convolutional network with predicting the next state
 for an entire grid at once, without the rule, then networks fail to converge to an
 accurate prediction that properly generalizes to arbitrary grid sizes[19].
 One way to look at this failing of neural networks is that they are simply mem
orizing the training data. Symbolic reasoning, in contrast, consists of rules which
 can be applied outside the distribution: a memorized solution to addition consists of
 a cleverly represented lookup-table, while a symbolic solution consists of an explicit
 procedure which adds digit-by-digit, keeping track of the carry value as it goes a
 procedure which generalizes to arbitrary input lengths. This is how humans solve
 symbolic tasks, and there is reason to believe AI agents need to acquire this ability
 to learn such procedures if they are to succeed on symbolic tasks.
 A striking characterization of the interplay between symbolic reasoning and the
 pattern recognition done by neural networks is described in dual-process theories of
 reasoning[18, 8, 11] which suggest that our abilities stem from the interaction between
 a fast, associative system (similar to that of modern deep nets) and a slower symbolic
 system. Neural networks excel at conducting associative reasoning, but are not suited
 to conducting rule-based reasoning in their computations. Current systems fail at
 systematicity and generalization, having an inability to form declarative, systematic
 8
knowledge and reason over it to solve new problems. Such an ability would be
 required for a machine to, for example, rediscover the scienti c method, and use this
 method to learn new things. As such, it is an important problem to address in the
 design of more generally intelligent systems.
 How might we combine learning of symbolic rules with machine learning to pro
duce more capable arti cial intelligence systems? This thesis attempts to make
 progress in this direction. To begin to solve this large challenge, it is helpful to have
 a benchmark that appropriately measures the ability we are seeking. Importantly, it
 must be designed in a way to prevent developers from hard-coding the knowledge into
 the system 1. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, developed by Francois Chollet
 and henceforth referred to as ARC, is an excellent test of this type of learning.
 Wepresent two approaches for solving ARC tasks designed to aid in both abstrac
tion and reasoning. In Section 2, we describe the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus.
 We discuss the relevance of the corpus of tasks with respect to the challenges put
 forward above, and outline existing work on the dataset. In Section 3 and Section 4,
 we develop two approaches and sets of results on ARC. The rst approach involves
 learning abstractions of symbolic concepts out of the solutions of tasks solved so far
 using a program synthesis system called DreamCoder. However, the type of search
 DreamCoder uses to discover solutions is weak and does not scale to solving general
 ARC problems. To address this, the second section develops a reasoning approach
 for ARC motivated by the reasoning humans exhibit when discovering solutions to
 ARCtasks. Our approach combines execution-guided program synthesis with deduc
tive reasoning based on inverse semantics, enabling a bidirectional program synthesis
 algorithm for ARC. We present preliminary results on ARC problems with this ap
proach, as well as application to a simpler domain of solving tasks from the 24
 Game family of puzzles. We conclude in Section 5 by discussing how these two
 approaches can be combined as well as future research directions relevant to ARC
 and AI in general.
 1This is not as much of an issue for benchmarks involving object recognition, language generation,
 etc. where hard-coding a recognizer yields poor performance. In contrast, systematic tasks are by
 nature easier to program.

 2 The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus
 In 2019, Francois Chollet released a paper On the Measure of Intelligence [4]. In it,
 Chollet argues that intelligence must be measured not as skill in a particular task, but
 as skill-acquisition e ciency. General intelligent systems must also have developer
aware generalization, meaning they can learn to solve problems the developer of the
 system has not encountered before or anticipated. As part of the paper, Chollet
 introduces the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, a benchmark he created in line
 with his view of measuring intelligence.
 ARC consists of a training set of 400 tasks, an evaluation set of 400 tasks, and
 a private test set of 200 tasks. Each task consists of a 24 training examples and
 one or more test examples. Each training example is an input/output pair of grids.
 To solve a task, an agent must determine the relationship between input and output
 grids in the training examples, and use this to produce the correct output grid for
 each of the test examples, for which the agent is only given the input grid.
 Importantly, the tasks are unique and constructed by hand so as to prevent
 reverse engineering any synthetic generation process. In addition, they are designed
 to depend on a set of human Core Knowledge inbuilt priors such as the notion of
 10
objectness, simple arithmetic abilities, symmetry, or goal-directedness.
 Chollet hosted a Kaggle-competition and the winning solution, a hard-coded
 brute force approach, achieved only 20% performance on the private test set [1].
 At the time of writing, we are not aware of any improvements upon this mark.
 2.1 Challenges of ARC
 The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus has a number of features which make it
 quite a challenging benchmark. To start, since each task is a few-shot problem
 whose solution is symbolic and mostly rule-based, neural networks are extremely
 poorly equipped for the benchmark. Second, the tasks in the private test set are
 not from the same distribution as the tasks in the training set. This prevents a
 developer from succeeding by hard-coding a program that can solve tasks in the
 training set unless that program learns to do so from the training set itself, or does
 so based on some sort of universal problem-solving technique that is not tailored to
 the observed idiosyncrasies of the training set. Last, the search for a solution to a
 task may be easy for humans, but for any rule-based approach, the search quickly
 explodes exponentially in a way which is infeasible without close supervision.
 2.2 Solving ARC
 As laid out in the paper, ARC is best thought of as a program synthesis benchmark.
 The most straightforward way to approach solving a task is to seek to write a pro
gram that converts the input grid to the output grid for each training example, and
 then evaluate this program on the test input grids. This is the general framework
 we will assume. Such an approach starts with a Domain Speci c Language of use
ful functions in this case, the DSL could be based on the Core Knowledge priors
 that form the foundation of ARC. These functions are then combined to produce
 programs. For example, the solution to the task in Figure 2 could be written in
 Pythonic style as
 f(in) = get_first(sort(map(objects(in),
 11
lambda obj: freq(obj, objects(in))))
 or more simply as f(in) = most_common_element(get_objects(in)). There is
 a trade-o here: starting with a universal (fundamentally, all we need is Turing
completeness) set of functions ensures any task solution is expressible, but solution
 programs may be so long that any search for them is prohibitively expensive. On
 the other hand, introducing specialized functions to reduce the description length of
 solution programs may not generalize well to the test set.
 To ensure the rigor of the benchmark, Chollet organized a Kaggle competition
 around it. The winning solution used a brute-force approach which solves roughly
 60% of the training tasks but only 20% of of the private test tasks[10]. To this day,
 this solution remains state of the art. In the words of the winner, Unfortunately, I
 dont feel like my solution itself brings us closer to AGI .
 As one might expect, two important components underlying a proper solution to
 ARC are the ability to conduct abstraction and reasoning. We brie y showcase this
 through a few examples. Figure 3 demonstrates the way concepts are introduced and
 developed through interrelated tasks. Figure 4 shows a task whose solution requires
 multiple steps of reasoning to uncover.
 In what follows, we will design approaches that address these two necessary com
ponents.
 3 Abstraction
 Our rst approach to ARC addresses the central desire of our system: the ability
 to learn symbolic rules from data. To do so we use DreamCoder, a recent tool for
 program synthesis [7]. What follows consists of essentially applying DreamCoder as
 designed to ARC without any signi cant modi cations. We show that it is well
suited to solving ARC tasks, and crucially enables the ability of learning the types
 of abstractions found in ARC.
 12
Figure 3: Abstraction: the concept of in ation and de ation is rst introduced
 in an isolated task before being combined with other concepts (symmetry, denoising)
 in more challenging tasks. To solve the harder tasks, an agent must learn concepts
 from the simpler tasks. Each task only shows a single training example for brevity.
 Figure 4: Reasoning: this challenging task 65 cannot be solved without a sort of
 step-by-step reasoning towards a solution. Reasoning on ARC is discussed further
 in 4. Can you solve it?
 13
3.1 DreamCoder
 DreamCoder is a program synthesis engine; it solves tasks by learning to write pro
grams which convert, in this case, the input grid into the target grid. As it solves
 tasks, it learns new abstractions through compression , an algorithm which distills
 higher-level functions out of existing task solutions. This allows DreamCoder to solve
 new tasks that it would not have been able to solve with its original library. Dream
Coder also trains a neural network to learn to recognize which functions are most
 likely to solve a given task. Together, compression and neural-guided synthesis allow
 DreamCoder to gradually acquire expertise in an area. For example, it rediscovers
 laws of classical physics (including Newtons and Coulombs laws) from much simpler
 functions, by compositionally building on concepts from those learned earlier.
 As a simple example, given only an addition function, DreamCoder can learn to
 solve multiplication tasks through repeated addition. Then, during compression,
 it refactors these multiplication programs to express them in terms of a higher-level
 multiplication function. This new function can be used to solve more di cult tasks
 such as calculating exponents or factorials.
 3.2 Enabling Generalization through Compression
 The compression component of DreamCoder is crucial to our program synthesis
 approach. After each iteration of attempting to solve ARC tasks, our agent looks
 at all of the correct programs, notices structures that were similar between di erent
 solved programs, and then re-writes new, higher-level programs based on lower-level
 programs.
 Compression enables our agent to learn new techniques and behaviors based on
 the tasks it is solving, rather than being limited to the tools the developer provided
 it with. This type of generalization ability is at the heart of the ARC challenge 
creating a machine that quickly learns to solve problems its developers might not
 have anticipated.
 We demonstrate how the synthesizer can create more abstract concepts from ex
isting ones in the following experiment. First, we supply our agent with six synthetic
 14
tasks (meant to be similar to ARC tasks): drawing a line in three di erent directions,
 and moving an object in three di erent directions. The programs synthesized are
 the following:
 (lambda (rotate_cw (draw_line_down (rotate_ccw $0)))) // draw line left
 (lambda (rotate_cw (move_down (rotate_ccw $0)))) // move object left
 (lambda (rotate_ccw (draw_line_down (rotate_cw $0)))) // draw line right
 (lambda (rotate_ccw (move_down (rotate_cw $0)))) // move object right
 (lambda (rotate_cw (rotate_cw (draw_line_down (rotate_cw (rotate_cw $0)))))) // draw line up
 (lambda (rotate_cw (rotate_cw (move_down (rotate_cw (rotate_cw $0)))))) // move object up
 After running the compression algorithm, the agent creates these new abstrac
tions:
 (lambda (lambda (rotate_cw ($0 (rotate_ccw $1))))) // apply action left
 (lambda (lambda (rotate_ccw ($0 (rotate_cw $1))))) // apply action right
 (lambda (lambda (rotate_cw (rotate_cw ($0 (rotate_cw (rotate_cw $1))))))) // apply action up
 (a) An example draw line left task
 (b) An example move object left task
 Figure 5: Sample tasks involving applying an action towards the left
 Thus, instead of our agent developing tunnel-vision and just becoming more and
 more suited to doing certain kinds of trained tasks, it is able to generalize knowledge
 and can then apply this knowledge to other tasks completely unrelated to drawing
 lines or moving objects.
 3.3 Enabling generalization on ARC symmetry tasks
 In a second experiment, we demonstrate how compression-based learning enables
 developer-aware generalization on the ARC dataset. We provide DreamCoder with
 a set of ve grid-manipulation operations: ipping vertically with vertical_flip,
 rotating clockwise with rotate_cw, overlaying two grids with overlay, stacking two
 15
grids vertically with stack_vertically, and getting the left half of a grid with
 left_half. We then train our agent on a subset of 36 ARC training tasks involving
 symmetry over ve iterations of enumeration and compression. During each iteration,
 our agent attempts to solve all 36 tasks by enumerating possible programs for each
 task. It then runs compression to create new abstractions. During the next iteration,
 the agent tries to solve all tasks again within the same amount of time but equipped
 with the new abstractions. In this experiment, our agent solves 16 tasks before any
 training. After one iteration, it solves 17 in the same amount of time. After another,
 it solves 19 tasks, and after the nal iteration, it solves 22.
 After each iteration, our agent learns new abstractions which help it solve tasks
 that were previously too di cult. Thus, the DreamCoder compression framework
 enables our agent to learn interpretable, compositional abstractions not provided by
 the developer, such as ipping horizontally, rotating counter-clockwise, and stacking
 grids horizontally. It uses these new abstractions to solve progressively harder tasks.
 The most di cult tasks solved involve mirroring the input grid four ways, requiring a
 synthesized program which is extremely long when expressed in terms of the original
 functions. Such a program would be very di cult to discover without compression
 due to its length and the exponential nature of program search.
 This experiment shows a promising path towards the developer-aware generaliza
tion required to succeed on the ARC dataset. In order to solve unknown tasks in the
 test set, our agent will need to learn from the tasks themselves. As shown in this
 experiment, DreamCoder is able to learn new concepts based on tasks given, which
 enable it to solve more di cult tasks.
 3.4 Neural-guided synthesis
 Guiding program enumeration with a neural network is a commonly used program
 synthesis technique to speed up search, and is included in DreamCoders synthesis
 approach. We showcase the appropriateness of this approach for the ARC dataset by
 comparing neural-guided synthesis with brute-force enumeration on a set of arti cial
 ARC-like tasks involving sorting blocks of various sizes. Training a neural network

 signs represent abstractions. Abstractions may rely on others for construction; e.g.
 to stack grids horizontally, we re ect each input diagonally, stack vertically, and
 re ect the vertical stack diagonally.

 improves the space of possible programs considered for a given task from O(n!) to
 roughly O(n) for a given program length. The network outputs a distribution over
 the set of functions using a convolutional network over the input/output grids. Doing
 so exponentially speeds up discovery of task solutions, as shown in Figure 8.
 3.5 Discussion
 It is useful to compare the learning done in our approach to that done by neural
 networks. Neural networks can also learn new concepts from training examples, but
 17

tion time. Note: for program solution length 8, brute force did not complete in a
 reasonable time.
 their internal representation lacks structure which allows them to apply learned con
cepts compositionally to other tasks. In contrast, functions learned via compression,
 represented as programs, can naturally be composed and extended to solve harder
 tasks, while reusing concepts between tasks. This constitutes a learning paradigm
 which we view as essential to human-like reasoning.
 Even so, there are aspects of neural network functionality we can take advantage
 of. Some human priors such as object detection and denoising might be best imple
mented through neural networks rather than as functional programs. Incorporating
 neural modules into program synthesis would allow us to bene t from the advan
tages of neural networks, while also bene ting from the advantage of writing tasks
 as programs.
 There is another important caveat of the approach shown here. While e ec
tive and applicable to a wide range of tasks, the neural-guided synthesis used by
 DreamCoder is too weak to scale to the complexity of ARC tasks. To guide search,
 DreamCoder uses a neural network to predict the likelihood, given a pair of func
tions f and g, that g will be used as argument i of function f. This form of guidance

cated reasoning.
 enables fast enumeration of programs, but provides imperfect supervision for more
 complex problems. In particular, it does not necessarily scale well to long programs
 with many repeated operations. The tasks in ARC often require such programs. In
 the next section, we will design a new reasoning approach that incorporates neu
ral networks to provide a more powerful form of guidance in the search for correct
 programs.
 4 Reasoning
 To solve ARC tasks, we need a way to imbue our agent with the ability to reason
 towards solutions. ARC tasks have rich visual queues that guide us towards solutions.
 Without enabling our agent to take full advantage of these queues, the search over
 possible programs becomes exhaustive and impossibly large. In addition, most ARC
 tasks require several steps of reasoning before discovering the solution. How can we
 design an approach that searches for ARC solutions the way humans do?
 Let us consider some motivating examples for our approach that showcase the
 step-by-step reasoning we will emulate. To solve a task, one must answer the ques
tion: by what rule can we derive the output grid from input grid for each example?
 Consider task 173 from Figure 10. The reasoning steps to come to a solution might
 19
Figure 10: Task 173
 look something like this:
 1. Notice that the output grid is one of the objects present in the input grid.
 2. Reframe the question: for each input grid, which object do we choose?
 3. Solution: the object chosen in each case di ers from others in its vertical
 symmetry.
 Note how observations are conditional on the contents of both the input and
 output grid. In addition, it is hard to imagine discovering the solution without
 making the rst observation.
 Figure 11 shows another example, whose reasoning steps might be as follows:
 1. Notice that the output grid consists of copies of the 3x3 input grid, arranged
 in a certain arrangement among a 9x9 grid.
 2. Reframe the question: where should we place copies of the input grid?
 3. Notice that the placement of the input grid matches the outline of a color for
 each grid. For example, in the rst example, the diagonal of grids in the output
 matches the pattern of green pixels in the input.
 4. Reframe the question: what color should we arrage our grid copies along?
 20
Figure 11: Task 303
 5. Notice that the color matched is the most common color in the grid.
 Again, note how discovery of the solution essentially relies on making these indi
vidual observations one at a time (although not necessarily in this order).
 Systematizing a form of reasoning for ARC that emulates this reasoning will be
 based on the concept of execution-guided program synthesis.
 4.1 Execution-guided Program Synthesis
 Execution-guided program synthesis [6, 3] is a form of program synthesis where one
 executes partial programs to produce intermediate outputs, which help guide the
 creation of the full program. This ameliorates the need for a machine learning agent
 to internally simulate the semantics of the program being written. Humans make
 use of the same thing: for instance, it much easier to write out the result of a
 multiplication digit by digit, instead of conducting the full calculation in ones head.
 The style of execution-guided synthesis applicable to ARC most closely follows
 that used in [6]. An example of using it applied to ARC is described in Figure 12.
 This is a powerful form of neural-guided program synthesis in that each step of
 reasoning is conditioned on the entire state of the problem: input, output, and partial
 evaluations. However, it is limited to bottom-up enumeration: the leaves of the
 program are constructed (and evaluated) rst. In contrast, the motivating reasoning
 21
Figure 12: Solving ARC task 138 from the evaluation set with execution-guided
 synthesis. Conditioned on the input and output grids, the agent chooses to ip the
 input horizontally in step one. This action is executed to produce intermediate value
 i1. Next, the agent chooses to horizontally stack the intermediate value with the
 input grid, producing another value i2. Last, the agent horizontally stacks this value
 i2 with itself, correctly producing the output grid for each example and solving the
 task.
 22
Figure 13: Left: the function block is directly invertible: given a target grid in its
 codomain, one can deduce what inputs are needed to produce that target. Right:
 the function hstack (horizontal stack) is conditionally invertible: given a valid com
bination of target grid and one of the inputs of the function, one can deduce the
 second input needed to produce the target.
 steps laid out for tasks 173 and 303 involve proposing a function that is used to
 produce the output grid, and deducing the inputs required to correctly produce the
 output as new intermediate targets before discovering the complete program.
 This form of deductive reasoning involves evaluating function in reverse. It is best
 exempli ed in the FlashMeta system [15], where one leverages the inverse semantics
 of operators to deduce one or more inputs of a function given the output target and
 one or more inputs. We will incorporate this type of reasoning into an extension of
 execution-guided program synthesis to enable a reasoning approach for ARC tasks.
 4.2 Deductive reasoning via inverse semantics
 For our purposes, we can consider two cases.
 The simplest case is when the function is invertible. In this case, we can evaluate
 the inverse to produce two new targets for the search, as shown in 13. The more
 23
common situation is when a function is conditionally invertible: given one or more
 inputs to the function and the output, one can deduce the remaining inputs needed
 such that when the function is evaluated the output is produced. A surprisingly large
 number of functions are conditionally invertible; perhaps the most familiar family is
 arithmetic operators: if we know 1 + x = 5, we can deduce that x = 4. An example
 relevant to ARC is shown in 13.
 The deductive reasoning in our motivating examples also takes the form of con
ditionally invertible functions. For task 173, one might write the solution as
 out = kronecker(in, filter_color(in, most_common_color(in)))
 In step 1, we determine that the output is the Kronecker product of the input grid
 with another grid. In step 2, we deduce the second input to kronecker by means
 of its conditional invertibility 2. Likewise, given the target grid which is the second
 input to kronecker, we deduce the second argument to filter_color conditioned
 on the rst argument being the input grid.
 For task 303, one might write the solution as
 out = filter(objects(in), lambda obj: has_vertical_symmetry(obj))
 The conditional inverse of filter tells us whether objects in the rst argument
 must lter to true or false. To make this t in our deductive framework, it is con
venient to have filter take a list of Boolean values as the second argument. This
 list of Booleans can then be produced as an intermediate target by the conditional
 inverse of filter, and is satis ed by mapping has_vertical_symmetry to the list
 objects(in). More details on designing a conditionally invertible DSL for ARC can
 be found in Appendix A.1.
 4.3 Bidirectional, Execution-guided Program Synthesis
 With the addition of the deductive reasoning powered by inverse and conditional
 inverse functions, we are ready to present the bidirectional, execution-guided algo
rithm for program synthesis. Like the approach in [6, 23], we approach the synthesis
 2There are some subtleties with the conditional inverse presented. The conditional inverse of
 kronecker is unique up to changes in color of the second argument.
 24
task via reinforcement learning. We assume we have a grammar G of functions, each
 of which has an arity, a type signature, and associated inverse or conditional inverse
 functions. This includes constants of arity zero. For example, the subtraction func
tion has two conditional inverses: one which produces the rst argument conditioned
 on the second, and vice versa.
 The underlying Markov Decision Process has the following components:
 The current state is a graph of nodes. Each node represents either an input
 value, the output value, or an intermediate value resulting from the execution of an
 operation in the forwards or backwards direction, and has a corresponding program
 informing how that node is created. A node is grounded if there is a valid program
 to create that node from the operations applied so far.
 For ARC, each value is a set of examples, each of which is a grid. Applying
 an operation implicitly applies the operation to each example in the set to produce
 a new set of examples as a new value.
 An operation is a function from the grammar along with a designation of being
 applied in forwards, inverse, or as a conditional inverse (and if as a conditional inverse,
 conditioned on which input arguments). There are three types of operations: forward
 operations, inverse operations, and conditional inverse operations.
 For an inverse operation, the sole argument will be the output value. For condi
tional inverse operations, the rst argument is the output, and the other arguments
 are a subset of the inputs.
 Aforward operation applies the function to a set of grounded inputs to produce a
 new grounded node. We restrict our functions to have a single output. An invertible
 operation takes an ungrounded output and produces a new ungrounded target node
 such that grounding the target node will cause the output node to be grounded
 as well. A conditionally invertible operation takes an ungrounded output and one
 or more grounded input nodes, and produces a new ungrounded target node such
 that grounding the target node will cause the output node to be grounded as well.
 All invertible and conditionally invertible operations have a corresponding forward
 operation.
 Multiple examples are placed in the same node. When an operation is applied, it
 25
calculates the result for each example, and equality testing is done based on whether
 all examples match each other.
 For a task with n input values per example and a single output value, the initial
 state consists of n grounded value nodes and one ungrounded target node. In general,
 grounded nodes correspond to those from the bottom-up side of the search, while
 ungrounded nodes correspond to those from the top-down side of the search.
 Solving a given task thus consist of an episode in the MDP where the agent seeks
 to solve the task by grounding the output value node. Actions in the MDP correspond
 to a choice of operation and the choice of arguments for that operation. Each action
 applies a function in either the forward or backward direction. Intuitively, this
 executes a bidirectional search to try to connect the grounded nodes on one side
 with the ungrounded output node on the other.
 The reward for solving a task is R. A penalty of 1 is applied for attempting
 to apply any invalid operation. Invalid operations may be caused by a number
 of causes, including type errors, using an ungrounded node as input to a forward
 function, using a grounded node as improper input to an inverse or conditional
 inverse function, applying an operation which creates a node that already exists,
 or providing an invalid argument to an operation for example, providing 3 as the
 conditioning argument to the inverse of an integer multiplication op when the output
 is not divisible by three. We can even keep track of the type of values, and give errors
 for violating the type signature of functions.
 Unlike [6], we refrain from garbage-collecting nodes used as arguments to a for
ward operation, or correspondingly garbage-collecting nodes that are the designated
 output of an inverse or conditional inverse operation.
 Given a sequence of actions that solve a task, only the subset of the actions
 corresponding to the functions used in the nal program are important to solve
 the task. We can give a shaped reward function which gives reward R P to the
 operations used in the nal program, where P is the length of the nal program,
 and zero otherwise (unless a penalty is applicable). Dividing by the length of the
 program encourages shorter solutions. We expected this reward to work better than
 standard reward-to-go with exponential decay due to the more targeted feedback.
 26
Network and training
 The neural network receives as input a set of (node_value, node_grounded) tuples,
 chooses one of O operations to apply and selects M arguments for the operation,
 where M is the arity of the operation. Each argument is a value node from those
 provided. We can constrain our network to only choose arguments whose types
 match the type signature of the chosen operation by automatically masking invalid
 options in the same manner as [23].
 Our network architecture mirrors that used by [6], with a network for embedding
 value nodes, a deep set embedding for the set of value nodes, and a pointer network
 for choosing arguments to an operation.
 We found the combination of supervised pretraining and ne-tuning with REIN
FORCE used in [6] to work best for training the model. An important di erence
 is that generating random bidirectional programs is more complicated than random
 forward programs. To do so, we randomly apply forward operations, choose a ran
dom node among the outputs, and recover the sequence of actions used to create this
 node. We then convert this forward program into a bidirectional program by proba
bilistically converting operations at the end of the program to inverse or conditional
 inverse operations when applicable.
 For test-time search, we stick with taking episode rollouts as they are easiest to
 implement. Unlike [6], we did not yet implement a value network for our system.
 4.4 Results
 We evaluate the bidirectional algorithm on a set of 18 ARC symmetry tasks a
 subset of those used in Section 3. Here, we provide our agent with six primitives
 shown in 1. We use a convolutional neural network to embed grid example sets.
 We trained on a set of randomly generated programs evaluated on random input
 grids from the ARC training set, and ne-tuned with REINFORCE before sampling
 rollouts for ten minutes on all tasks at once. The agent is able to solve 13 of 18
 tasks, shown in Figure 14. Unfortunately, it struggles to scale to tasks requiring
 more than a few operations. The four-way mirror tasks solved at the end of the

 experiments in 3.3 remain unsolved, as well as two even harder tasks. For some
 reason we were not able to get the REINFORCE learning to consistently improve
 results. Here, equal performance came from using the supervised model directly,
 with REINFORCE yielding no improvement.
 To gain more insight into the performance of a forward-only search with the
 new bidirectional algorithm, we evaluate the agent in a simpler domain: solving 24
 Game problems. A 24 Game consists of four input numbers and a target number
 24. To solve the task, one must use each number once in an arithmetic expression
 that creates 24. For example, given 8, 1, 3, and 2, a solution is 24 = (2 1) 3 8.
 Solving a 24 problem requires similar reasoning to that solving ARC tasks: one
 executes various operations and tries to get closer to 24. We can use the conditional
 inverses of each arithmetic operator to facilitate a bidirectional search. For example,
 the conditional inverse of multiplication applied to 24 with 6 as one input yields 4
 as a new target. The 24 Game serves as a good alternative benchmark of the ability
 of our system, and lets us measure how important the bidirectional reasoning is to
 system performance.3
 For the supervised pretraining of our model, we train for 10,000 epochs on a
 dataset of randomly generated programs between depth one and four which yields
 50,000 training examples of actions. Programs may create any number as a target,
 324 Game is played with the rule that each number must be used exactly once in the expression
 to create 24. We relax this rule as it is not relevant for the program synthesis our agent is originally
 designed to carry out.

 not just 24, with the maximum allowed integer 100, and no negative or nonintegral
 numbers allowed. We then ne-tune with REINFORCE for 10,000 epochs of 1000
 actions taken each. We measure performance at the end of training as a function
 depth, and compare the full bidirectional, execution-guided algorithm with a forward
only baseline that only applies operations in the forwards direction with no inverse
 operations.
 Results are shown in Table 2. Accuracy remains fairly high as depth increases.
 This is because although tasks under depth four are generated through the applica
tion of four operations, as many as 40% remain solvable in fewer than four actions.
 Another observation is that bidirectional synthesis outperforms forward only across
 all depths. However, this should be questioned: its not clear why forward-only per
formance di ers so much between depths. In fact, for depth one tasks, there should
 be no di erence between forward-only and bidirectional approaches, since either way
 the solution takes a single action. So the disparity is likely the result of some bug
 rather than a meaningful di erence, or peculiarities with how REINFORCE is tuning
 our model.
 Besides bugs, there are a few reasons why learning to solve tasks with REIN
FORCE is not working as well as one might hope here. First, our hyperparameters
 may need to be tuned. Second, we may need to train for much longer. Compared
 to the number of examples seen during supervised training, the amount seen during
 policy gradient is quite low. This is due to the time taken to simulate the search
 graph environment while playing episodes. Last, our network architecture may need
 tuning or strengthening as well.

 ameliorate this issue would be a good next step.
 5 Discussion
 As one of the rst documented e orts towards developing a principled learning ap
proach to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, we have proposed and tested two
 directions independently. The rst addresses the abstraction required for ARC; it
 uses the compression algorithm from DreamCoder to learn abstractions of rule-based
 31
behavior to enable further pro ciency and compositional generalization on progres
sively more challenging tasks. The second addresses the reasoning required for ARC;
 it uni es execution-guided program synthesis, a bottom-up synthesis method, with
 top-down deductive reasoning via inverse semantics. This enables a bidirectional
 program synthesis algorithm well-suited to solving tasks like those seen in ARC, and
 addresses the di culties DreamCoder faces in scaling search to the level required for
 performance on ARC.
 The next important step is to combined these two approaches to create a uni ed
 system capable of both abstraction and reasoning on ARC. Neither approach is com
pletely su cient on its own. Without a strong reasoning approach, DreamCoders
 search algorithm is too weak to scale to challenging ARC tasks. But without the abil
ity to create new abstractions, the bidirectional, execution-guided synthesis is limited
 to solving tasks via whatever functions the developer provides it with. This requires
 a carefully crafted DSL, which not only goes against the spirit of ARC but inevitably
 leads to limited performance on the hidden test set, which likely builds on functions
 not seen in the training or evaluation sets. Luckily, combining the two approaches
 is very possible: new functions created by DreamCoders abstraction algorithm can
 be provided to the bidirectional search algorithm, which can use these functions to
 solve new tasks. In essence, we can replace DreamCoders neural-guided search al
gorithm with the more powerful bidirectional, execution-guided search. Tasks solved
 by the bidirectional search can be given to DreamCoders compression algorithm to
 produce new functions. We can then train the bidirectional algorithm to use these
 new functions by sampling random programs in them in a manner similar to the way
 DreamCoder does.
 In addition to learning forward functions, it would be nice if our bidirectional
 agent could learn inverses and conditional inverses of new abstractions. One ap
proach to this would be to treat these as synthesis problems of their own, sampling
 random inputs and tasking our system with creating a function which converts out
puts into inputs, perhaps conditioned on a subset of inputs. We hope to explore
 these possibilities for future work.
 There are a few other important further directions to consider for those interested
 32
in making progress on ARC. An important limit of all systems developed so far is
 their reliance on explicit programs to represent solutions to tasks. As discussed in
 Section 3.5, representing solutions with neural modules rather than programs opens
 the door to systems that are more exible and rely less on hard-coded reasoning
 systems like that described here. In the introduction, we stressed the importance
 of moving away from systems whose reasoning abilities are task-speci c and imple
mented by the developer. Yet the bidirectional algorithm proposed is an example of
 just such a thing. Generalizing the algorithm to something more widely applicable
 is an important step. For example, deductive reasoning could be implemented in the
 form of local causality-propagating systems of neural modules.
 Another direction involves addressing the vast amounts of prior knowledge hu
mans bring to a challenge like ARC. Large generative pretrained models [2, 16] o er
 a potential way to incorporate prior knowledge in this manner. It remains to be seen
 the extent to which such models can generalize to the idiosyncratic ARC environ
ment of discrete-colored grids, but the impressive improvements shown over the past
 few years indicate that betting against such models is not safe.
 The di culty of performing well on ARC without resorting to developer-provided
 brute-force solutions is a testament to its design as a measure of intelligence. Not
 only is it di cult, but its design captures the exact challenges facing us in arti
cial intelligence. We hope that the benchmark continues to receive attention and
 motivates new learning algorithms to get us closer to the development of generally
 intelligent machines.
 A Appendix
 A.1 A bidirectional grammar for ARC tasks
 A lot of e ort went into designing a set of functions suited to solving ARC tasks
 that facilitates bidirectional reasoning. While not used in the results shown here, we
 record the details to exemplify the potential of inverse semantics for ARC, and in
 the interest of assisting future work.
 33
Figure 15: Task 148
 Most of the operations in use are straightforward operations to get a list of objects,
 color in a grid, lter all but one color in a grid, set the background color, stack grids
 horizontally or vertically, and so on. We only address more interesting operations
 designed to facilitate the use of inverse functions and conditional inverse functions
 in an execution-guided setting.
 A.1.1 List operations
 Many list operations such as map, filter and sort take a function as an argument.
 Functions, however, are not well-suited for execution-guided synthesis, as one cannot
 evaluate intermediate constructions while making them. To address this, we can
 change the type signatures of the functions. To start, we allow any function to be
 vectorized, so that to map a function to a list, one can simply incrementally apply
 functions to the list. For example,
 We can modify filter to take a Boolean list as a second argument instead
 of a Boolean function, and return only the items in the rst list for whom the
 corresponding second element is true. Similarly, we can modify sort to take a list
 of integers as a second argument, and return the rst list sorted using the elements
 of the second list as keys for comparison.
 The function map is a little di erent. Given an input list and a target list, we can
 conduct a change of basis to create a new synthesis problem whose input/output
 examples are the elements of the list. For example, for task 148 (Figure 15), we might
 apply a forward operation to get a list of nine 3x3 grids, and an inverse operation to
 34
Figure 16: Task 168
 get a list of nine pixels as a new target from the output grid. By applying the map
 change of basis, we can create a new synthesis task with 36 training examples, each
 of which is a pair of a 3x3 input grid and an output pixel which is black or blue. With
 this change of basis, one can continue to construct a solution via execution-guided
 synthesis.
 There are other types of change of basis operations we can create. One example
 is to remap colors in the input and output grids based on frequency on a per-example
 basis. This is a strategy used by the winning Kaggle competition [10]. One can think
 of this as applying an invertible operation to the input grid in the forwards direction,
 and then applying its inverse to the output grid. Any invertible operation could be
 used in this manner. For example, we could rotate both the input and output grid
 clockwise4
 There is one more important operation, one that formed our original motivation
 for designing a bidirectional approach to ARC. Consider task 168 (Figure 16). To
 begin, we can get a list of objects in the input and output grids. Getting a list of ob
jects from the output can be thought of as the inverse of a function place_into_grid
 which takes a list of (positioned) objects and embeds them in a grid. If we apply a
 map change of basis, we then have a new task mapping grey shapes to colored versions
 4One way of thinking about this is that in rotating the output grid clockwise, we are applying
 the inverse, rotate counter-clockwise, in the backwards direction.
 35
of themselves. We can apply the conditional inverse color_in(grid, color) with
 the input grid supplied as the condiitoning argument to produce a new task: given a
 grid, deduce what color to color it in. If we then apply area in the forwards direction
 to get the area of each grid, then we get an association between integers and colors.
 If this were a synthesis task, the solution would be simple: it is a simple lookup: all
 identical inputs map to the same output. We can include a lookup operation which
 connects the two sides of the bidirectional search this way.
 One last example, task 10, exempli es the capabilities of bidirectional, execution
guided synthesis. In order, we can:
 • Split the input into a list of objects in the forwards direction
 • Apply add gridlines in reverse to the output to create a new target with the
 gridlines removed.
 • Apply in ate in reverse (conditioned on the in ate factor, a constant 3) to
 produce a 3x3 grid target.
 • Apply the lter conditional inverse: given the input list, and the target
 element which is a member of the list, produce a new target list of Booleans
 which is true for the element chosen and false otherwise.
 • Apply area in the forwards direction to the list of objects.
 • Apply lookup between the list of areas and the list of Booleans. The only
 object chosen is that with area four.
 A visual demonstration of this search is shown in Figure 17.

 Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions
 and Their Computation by Machine, Part I
 John McCarthy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. ∗
 April 1960
 1 Introduction
 A programming system called LISP (for LISt Processor) has been developed
 for the IBM 704 computer by the Artificial Intelligence group at M.I.T. The
 system was designed to facilitate experiments with a proposed system called
 the Advice Taker, whereby a machine could be instructed to handle declarative
 as well as imperative sentences and could exhibit “common sense” in carrying
 out its instructions. The original proposal [1] for the Advice Taker was made
 in November 1958. The main requirement was a programming system for
 manipulating expressions representing formalized declarative and imperative
 sentences so that the Advice Taker system could make deductions.
 In the course of its development the LISP system went through several
 stages of simplification and eventually came to be based on a scheme for rep
resenting the partial recursive functions of a certain class of symbolic expres
sions. This representation is independent of the IBM 704 computer, or of any
 other electronic computer, and it now seems expedient to expound the system
 by starting with the class of expressions called S-expressions and the functions
 called S-functions.

In this article, we first describe a formalism for defining functions recur
sively. We believe this formalism has advantages both as a programming
 language and as a vehicle for developing a theory of computation. Next, we
 describe S-expressions and S-functions, give some examples, and then describe
 the universal S-function apply which plays the theoretical role of a universal
 Turing machine and the practical role of an interpreter. Then we describe the
 representation of S-expressions in the memory of the IBM 704 by list structures
 similar to those used by Newell, Shaw and Simon [2], and the representation
 of S-functions by program. Then we mention the main features of the LISP
 programming system for the IBM 704. Next comes another way of describ
ing computations with symbolic expressions, and finally we give a recursive
 function interpretation of flow charts.
 We hope to describe some of the symbolic computations for which LISP
 has been used in another paper, and also to give elsewhere some applications
 of our recursive function formalism to mathematical logic and to the problem
 of mechanical theorem proving.
 2 Functions and Function Definitions
 We shall need a number of mathematical ideas and notations concerning func
tions in general. Most of the ideas are well known, but the notion of conditional
 expression is believed to be new1, and the use of conditional expressions per
mits functions to be defined recursively in a new and convenient way.
 a. Partial Functions. A partial function is a function that is defined only
 on part of its domain. Partial functions necessarily arise when functions are
 defined by computations because for some values of the arguments the com
putation defining the value of the function may not terminate. However, some
 of our elementary functions will be defined as partial functions.
 b. Propositional Expressions and Predicates. A propositional expression is
 an expression whose possible values are T (for truth) and F (for falsity). We
 shall assume that the reader is familiar with the propositional connectives ∧
 (“and”), ∨ (“or”), and ¬ (“not”). Typical propositional expressions are:
 1
 reference Kleene
 2
x <y
 (x < y)∧(b = c)
 x is prime
 Apredicate is a function whose range consists of the truth values T and F.
 c. Conditional Expressions. The dependence of truth values on the values
 of quantities of other kinds is expressed in mathematics by predicates, and the
 dependence of truth values on other truth values by logical connectives. How
ever, the notations for expressing symbolically the dependence of quantities of
 other kinds on truth values is inadequate, so that English words and phrases
 are generally used for expressing these dependences in texts that describe other
 dependences symbolically. For example, the function |x| is usually defined in
 words. Conditional expressions are a device for expressing the dependence of
 quantities on propositional quantities. A conditional expression has the form
 (p1 → e1,···,pn → en)
 where the p’s are propositional expressions and the e’s are expressions of any
 kind. It may be read, “If p1 then e1 otherwise if p2 then e2, ··· , otherwise if
 pn then en,” or “p1 yields e1,···,pn yields en.” 2
 We now give the rules for determining whether the value of
 (p1 → e1,···,pn → en)
 is defined, and if so what its value is. Examine the p’s from left to right. If
 a p whose value is T is encountered before any p whose value is undefined is
 encountered then the value of the conditional expression is the value of the
 corresponding e (if this is defined). If any undefined p is encountered before
 2
 I sent a proposal for conditional expressions to a CACM forum on what should be
 included in Algol 60. Because the item was short, the editor demoted it to a letter to the
 editor, for which CACM subsequently apologized. The notation given here was rejected for
 Algol 60, because it had been decided that no new mathematical notation should be allowed
 in Algol 60, and everything new had to be English. The if ...then...else that Algol 60
 adopted was suggested by John Backus.
 3
a true p, or if all p’s are false, or if the e corresponding to the first true p is
 undefined, then the value of the conditional expression is undefined. We now
 give examples.
 (1 < 2 →4,1>2→3)=4
 (2 < 1 →4,2>1→3,2>1→2)=3
 (2 < 1 →4,T →3)=3
 (2 < 1 → 0
 0 ,T →3)=3
 (2 < 1 →3,T → 0
 0 ) is undefined
 (2 < 1 →3,4<1→4) is undefined
 Some of the simplest applications of conditional expressions are in giving
 such definitions as
 |x| = (x < 0 →−x,T →x)
 δij = (i = j → 1,T →0)
 sgn(x) = (x < 0 → −1,x = 0→0,T →1)
 d. Recursive Function Definitions. By using conditional expressions we
 can, without circularity, define functions by formulas in which the defined
 function occurs. For example, we write
 n! = (n =0→1,T →n·(n−1)!)
 When we use this formula to evaluate 0! we get the answer 1; because of the
 way in which the value of a conditional expression was defined, the meaningless
 4
expression 0 · (0- 1)! does not arise. The evaluation of 2! according to this
 definition proceeds as follows:
 2! = (2=0→1,T →2·(2−1)!)
 = 2·1!
 = 2·(1=0→1T →·(1−1)!)
 = 2·1·0!
 = 2·1·(0 =0→1,T →0·(0−1)!)
 = 2·1·1
 = 2
 We now give two other applications of recursive function definitions. The
 greatest common divisor, gcd(m,n), of two positive integers m and n is com
puted by means of the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is expressed by
 the recursive function definition:
 gcd(m,n) = (m > n →gcd(n,m),rem(n,m) = 0 → m,T → gcd(rem(n,m),m))
 where rem(n,m) denotes the remainder left when n is divided by m.
 The Newtonian algorithm for obtaining an approximate square root of a
 number a, starting with an initial approximation x and requiring that an
 acceptable approximation y satisfy |y2 − a| < ϵ, may be written as
 sqrt(a, x, ϵ)
 = (|x2 −a| < ϵ → x,T → sqrt (a, 1
 2
 (x+ a
 x
 ),ϵ))
 The simultaneous recursive definition of several functions is also possible,
 and we shall use such definitions if they are required.
 There is no guarantee that the computation determined by a recursive
 definition will ever terminate and, for example, an attempt to compute n!
 from our definition will only succeed if n is a non-negative integer. If the
 computation does not terminate, the function must be regarded as undefined
 for the given arguments.
 The propositional connectives themselves can be defined by conditional
 expressions. We write
 5
p ∧q = (p→q,T →F)
 p ∨q = (p→T,T →q)
 ¬p = (p→F,T →T)
 p ⊃q = (p→q,T →T)
 It is readily seen that the right-hand sides of the equations have the correct
 truth tables. If we consider situations in which p or q may be undefined, the
 connectives ∧ and ∨ are seen to be noncommutative. For example if p is false
 and q is undefined, we see that according to the definitions given above p ∧ q
 is false, but q ∧ p is undefined. For our applications this noncommutativity is
 desirable, since p∧q is computed by first computing p, and if p is false q is not
 computed. If the computation for p does not terminate, we never get around
 to computing q. We shall use propositional connectives in this sense hereafter.
 e. Functions and Forms. It is usual in mathematics—outside of mathe
matical logic—to use the word “function” imprecisely and to apply it to forms
 such as y2+x. Because we shall later compute with expressions for functions,
 we need a distinction between functions and forms and a notation for express
ing this distinction. This distinction and a notation for describing it, from
 which we deviate trivially, is given by Church [3].
 Let f be an expression that stands for a function of two integer variables.
 It should make sense to write f(3,4) and the value of this expression should be
 determined. The expression y2+x does not meet this requirement; y2+x(3,4)
 is not a conventional notation, and if we attempted to define it we would be
 uncertain whether its value would turn out to be 13 or 19. Church calls an
 expression like y2 + x, a form. A form can be converted into a function if we
 can determine the correspondence between the variables occurring in the form
 and the ordered list of arguments of the desired function. This is accomplished
 by Church’s λ-notation.
 If E is a form in variables x1,···,xn, then λ((x1,···,xn),E) will be taken
 to be the function of n variables whose value is determined by substituting
 the arguments for the variables x1,···,xn in that order in E and evaluating
 the resulting expression. For example, λ((x,y),y2 + x) is a function of two
 variables, and λ((x,y),y2 + x)(3,4) = 19.
 The variables occurring in the list of variables of a λ-expression are dummy
 or bound, like variables of integration in a definite integral. That is, we may
 6
change the names of the bound variables in a function expression without
 changing the value of the expression, provided that we make the same change
 for each occurrence of the variable and do not make two variables the same
 that previously were different. Thus λ((x,y),y2 + x),λ((u,v),v2 + u) and
 λ((y,x),x2 + y) denote the same function.
 We shall frequently use expressions in which some of the variables are
 bound by λ’s and others are not. Such an expression may be regarded as
 defining a function with parameters. The unbound variables are called free
 variables.
 An adequate notation that distinguishes functions from forms allows an
 unambiguous treatment of functions of functions. It would involve too much
 of a digression to give examples here, but we shall use functions with functions
 as arguments later in this report.
 Difficulties arise in combining functions described by λ-expressions, or by
 any other notation involving variables, because different bound variables may
 be represented by the same symbol. This is called collision of bound variables.
 There is a notation involving operators that are called combinators for com
bining functions without the use of variables. Unfortunately, the combinatory
 expressions for interesting combinations of functions tend to be lengthy and
 unreadable.
 f. Expressions for Recursive Functions. The λ-notation is inadequate for
 naming functions defined recursively. For example, using λ’s, we can convert
 the definition
 sqrt(a, x,ϵ) = (|x2 − a| < ϵ → x,T → sqrt(a, 1
 2 (x+ a
 x ),ϵ))
 into
 sqrt = λ((a,x,ϵ),(|x2 − a| < ϵ → x,T → sqrt(a, 1
 2 (x+ a
 x ),ϵ))),
 but the right-hand side cannot serve as an expression for the function be
cause there would be nothing to indicate that the reference to sqrt within the
 expression stood for the expression as a whole.
 In order to be able to write expressions for recursive functions, we intro
duce another notation. label(a,E) denotes the expression E, provided that
 occurrences of a within E are to be interpreted as referring to the expression
 7
as a whole. Thus we can write
 label(sqrt, λ((a,x,ϵ),(|x2 − a| < ϵ → x,T → sqrt(a, 1
 2
 (x + a
 x
 ),ϵ))))
 as a name for our sqrt function.
 The symbol a in label (a,E) is also bound, that is, it may be altered
 systematically without changing the meaning of the expression. It behaves
 differently from a variable bound by a λ, however.
 3 RecursiveFunctionsof Symbolic Expressions
 We shall first define a class of symbolic expressions in terms of ordered pairs
 and lists. Then we shall define five elementary functions and predicates, and
 build from them by composition, conditional expressions, and recursive def
initions an extensive class of functions of which we shall give a number of
 examples. We shall then show how these functions themselves can be ex
pressed as symbolic expressions, and we shall define a universal function apply
 that allows us to compute from the expression for a given function its value
 for given arguments. Finally, we shall define some functions with functions as
 arguments and give some useful examples.
 a. A Class of Symbolic Expressions. We shall now define the S-expressions
 (S stands for symbolic). They are formed by using the special characters
 ·
 )
 (
 and an infinite set of distinguishable atomic symbols. For atomic symbols,
 we shall use strings of capital Latin letters and digits with single imbedded
 8
blanks.3 Examples of atomic symbols are
 A
 ABA
 APPLE PIE NUMBER 3
 There is a twofold reason for departing from the usual mathematical prac
tice of using single letters for atomic symbols. First, computer programs fre
quently require hundreds of distinguishable symbols that must be formed from
 the 47 characters that are printable by the IBM 704 computer. Second, it is
 convenient to allow English words and phrases to stand for atomic entities for
 mnemonic reasons. The symbols are atomic in the sense that any substructure
 they may have as sequences of characters is ignored. We assume only that dif
ferent symbols can be distinguished. S-expressions are then defined as follows:
 1. Atomic symbols are S-expressions.
 2. If e1 and e2 are S-expressions, so is (e1 · e2).
 Examples of S-expressions are
 AB
 (A· B)
 ((AB · C)·D)
 An S-expression is then simply an ordered pair, the terms of which may be
 atomic symbols or simpler S-expressions. We can can represent a list of arbi
trary length in terms of S-expressions as follows. The list
 (m1,m2,···,mn)
 is represented by the S-expression
 (m1 · (m2 ·(···(mn · NIL)···)))
 Here NIL is an atomic symbol used to terminate lists. Since many of the
 symbolic expressions with which we deal are conveniently expressed as lists,
 we shall introduce a list notation to abbreviate certain S-expressions. We have
 31995 remark: Imbedded blanks could be allowed within symbols, because lists were then
 written with commas between elements.
 9
l. (m) stands for (m ·NIL).
 2. (m1,···,mn) stands for (m1 · (···(mn · NIL)···)).
 3. (m1,···,mn · x) stands for (m1 · (···(mn · x)···)).
 Subexpressions can be similarly abbreviated. Some examples of these ab
breviations are
 ((AB,C),D) for ((AB ·(C ·NIL))·(D ·NIL))
 ((A,B),C,D ·E) for ((A·(B ·NIL))·(C ·(D ·E)))
 Since we regard the expressions with commas as abbreviations for those
 not involving commas, we shall refer to them all as S-expressions.
 b. Functions of S-expressions and the Expressions That Represent Them.
 Wenow define a class of functions of S-expressions. The expressions represent
ing these functions are written in a conventional functional notation. However,
 in order to clearly distinguish the expressions representing functions from S
expressions, we shall use sequences of lower-case letters for function names
 and variables ranging over the set of S-expressions. We also use brackets and
 semicolons, instead of parentheses and commas, for denoting the application
 of functions to their arguments. Thus we write
 car[x]
 car[cons[(A · B);x]]
 In these M-expressions (meta-expressions) any S-expression that occur stand
 for themselves.
 c. The Elementary S-functions and Predicates. We introduce the following
 functions and predicates:
 1. atom. atom[x] has the value of T or F according to whether x is an
 atomic symbol. Thus
 atom [X] = T
 atom [(X · A)] = F
 2. eq. eq [x;y] is defined if and only if both x and y are atomic. eq [x; y]
 = Tif x and y are the same symbol, and eq [x; y] = F otherwise. Thus
 10
eq [X; X] = T
 eq [X; A] = F
 eq [X; (X · A)] is undefined.
 3. car. car[x] is defined if and only if x is not atomic. car [(e1 · e2)] = e1.
 Thus car [X] is undefined.
 car [(X · A)] = X
 car [((X · A) · Y )] = (X ·A)
 4. cdr. cdr [x] is also defined when x is not atomic. We have cdr
 [(e1 · e2)] = e2. Thus cdr [X] is undefined.
 cdr [(X · A)] = A cdr [((X ·A)·Y)] = Y
 5. cons. cons [x; y] is defined for any x and y. We have cons [e1;e2] =
 (e1 · e2). Thus
 cons [X; A] = (X A)
 cons [(X · A);Y] = ((X ·A)Y)
 car, cdr, and cons are easily seen to satisfy the relations
 car [cons [x; y]] = x
 cdr [cons [x; y]] = y
 cons [car [x]; cdr [x]] = x, provided that x is not atomic.
 The names “car” and “cons” will come to have mnemonic significance only
 when we discuss the representation of the system in the computer. Composi
tions of car and cdr give the subexpressions of a given expression in a given
 position. Compositions of cons form expressions of a given structure out of
 parts. The class of functions which can be formed in this way is quite limited
 and not very interesting.
 d. Recursive S-functions. We get a much larger class of functions (in fact,
 all computable functions) when we allow ourselves to form new functions of
 S-expressions by conditional expressions and recursive definition. We now give
 11
some examples of functions that are definable in this way.
 1. ff[x]. The value of ff[x] is the first atomic symbol of the S-expression x
 with the parentheses ignored. Thus
 f
 f[((A · B) · C)] = A
 We have
 f
 f[x] = [atom[x] → x;T → ff[car[x]]]
 We now trace in detail the steps in the evaluation of
 f
 f [((A · B) · C)]:
 f
 f [((A · B) · C)]
 = [atom[((A·B)·C)] → ((A·B)·C);T → ff[car[((A·B)C·)]]]
 = [F →((A·B)·C);T →ff[car[((A·B)·C)]]]
 = [T →ff[car[((A·B)·C)]]]
 = ff[car[((A·B)·C)]]
 = ff[(A·B)]
 = [atom[(A·B)] → (A·B);T → ff[car[(A·B)]]]
 = [F →(A·B);T →ff[car[(A·B)]]]
 = [T →ff[car[(A·B)]]]
 = ff[car[(A·B)]]
 = ff[A]
 12
= [atom[A] → A;T →ff[car[A]]]
 = [T →A;T →ff[car[A]]]
 = A
 2. subst [x;y;z]. This function gives the result of substituting the S
expression x for all occurrences of the atomic symbol y in the S-expression z.
 It is defined by
 subst [x; y; z] = [atom [z] → [eq [z; y] → x; T → z];
 T →cons [subst [x; y; car [z]]; subst [x; y; cdr [z]]]]
 As an example, we have
 subst[(X · A);B;((A · B) · C)] = ((A· (X ·A))·C)
 3. equal [x; y]. This is a predicate that has the value T if x and y are the
 same S-expression, and has the value F otherwise. We have
 equal [x; y] = [atom [x] ∧ atom [y] ∧ eq [x; y]]
 ∨[¬ atom [x] ∧¬ atom [y] ∧ equal [car [x]; car [y]]
 ∧ equal [cdr [x]; cdr [y]]]
 It is convenient to see how the elementary functions look in the abbreviated
 list notation. The reader will easily verify that
 (i) car[(m1,m2,···,mn)] = m1
 (ii) cdr[(ms,m2,···,mn)] = (m2,···,mn)
 (iii) cdr[(m)] = NIL
 (iv) cons[m1;(m2,···,mn)] = (m1,m2,···,mn)
 (v) cons[m;NIL] = (m)
 We define
 13
null[x] = atom[x] ∧ eq[x;NIL]
 This predicate is useful in dealing with lists.
 Compositions of car and cdr arise so frequently that many expressions can
 be written more concisely if we abbreviate
 cadr[x] for car[cdr[x]],
 caddr[x] for car[cdr[cdr[x]]], etc.
 Another useful abbreviation is to write list [e1;e2;···;en]
 for cons[e1;cons[e2;···;cons[en;NIL]···]].
 This function gives the list, (e1,···,en), as a function of its elements.
 The following functions are useful when S-expressions are regarded as lists.
 1. append [x;y].
 append [x; y] = [null[x] → y; T → cons [car [x]; append [cdr [x]; y]]]
 An example is
 append [(A, B); (C, D, E)] = (A, B, C, D, E)
 2. among [x;y]. This predicate is true if the S-expression x occurs among
 the elements of the list y. We have
 among[x;y] = ¬null[y] ∧ [equal[x;car[y]] ∨ among[x;cdr[y]]]
 3. pair [x;y]. This function gives the list of pairs of corresponding elements
 of the lists x and y. We have
 pair[x; y] = [null[x]∧null[y] → NIL;¬atom[x]∧¬atom[y] → cons[list[car[x];car[y]];pair[cdr[x];cdr[y]]]
 An example is
 pair[(A,B,C);(X,(Y,Z),U)] = ((A,X),(B,(Y,Z)),(C,U)).
 14
4. assoc [x;y]. If y is a list of the form ((u1,v1),···,(un,vn)) and x is one
 of the u’s, then assoc [x;y] is the corresponding v. We have
 assoc[x;y] = eq[caar[y];x] → cadar[y];T → assoc[x;cdr[y]]]
 An example is
 assoc[X;((W,(A,B)),(X,(C,D)),(Y,(E,F)))] = (C,D).
 5. sublis[x;y]. Here x is assumed to have the form of a list of pairs
 ((u1, v1), · · ·, (un,vn)), where the u’s are atomic, and y may be any S-expression.
 The value of sublis[x;y] is the result of substituting each v for the correspond
ing u in y. In order to define sublis, we first define an auxiliary function. We
 have
 sub2[x;z] = [null[x] → z;eq[caar[x];z] → cadar[x];T → sub2[cdr[x];z]]
 and
 sublis[x; y] = [atom[y] → sub2[x;y];T → cons[sublis[x;car[y]];sublis[x;cdr[y]]]
 We have
 sublis [((X, (A, B)), (Y, (B, C))); (A, X · Y)] = (A, (A, B), B, C)
 e. Representation of S-Functions by S-Expressions. S-functions have been
 described by M-expressions. We now give a rule for translating M-expressions
 into S-expressions, in order to be able to use S-functions for making certain
 computations with S-functions and for answering certain questions about S
functions.
 The translation is determined by the following rules in rich we denote the
 translation of an M-expression E by E*.
 1. If E is an S-expression E* is (QUOTE, E).
 2. Variables and function names that were represented by strings of lower
case letters are translated to the corresponding strings of the corresponding
 uppercase letters. Thus car* is CAR, and subst* is SUBST.
 3. A form f[e1;···;en] is translated to (f∗,e∗
 1 ···,e∗
 n). Thus cons [car [x];
 cdr [x]]∗ is (CONS, (CAR, X), (CDR, X)).
 4. {[p1 → e1;···;pn → en]}∗ is (COND, (p∗
 1,e∗
 1),···,(p∗
 n · e∗
 n)).
 15
5. {λ[[x1;···;xn];E]}∗ is (LAMBDA, (x∗
 1,···,x∗
 n),E∗).
 6. {label[a;E]}∗ is (LABEL, a∗, E∗).
 With these conventions the substitution function whose M-expression is
 label [subst; λ [[x; y; z]; [atom [z] → [eq [y; z] → x; T → z]; T → cons [subst
 [x; y; car [z]]; subst [x; y; cdr [z]]]]]] has the S-expression
 (LABEL, SUBST, (LAMBDA, (X, Y, Z), (COND ((ATOM, Z), (COND,
 (EQ, Y, Z), X), ((QUOTE, T), Z))), ((QUOTE, T), (CONS, (SUBST, X, Y,
 (CAR Z)), (SUBST, X, Y, (CDR, Z)))))))
 This notation is writable and somewhat readable. It can be made easier
 to read and write at the cost of making its structure less regular. If more
 characters were available on the computer, it could be improved considerably.4
 f. The Universal S-Function apply. There is an S-function apply with the
 property that if f is an S-expression for an S-function f′ and args is a list of
 arguments of the form (arg1,···,argn), where arg1,···,argn are arbitrary S
expressions, then apply[f;args] and f′[arg1;···;argn] are defined for the same
 values of arg1,···,argn, and are equal when defined. For example,
 λ[[x; y]; cons[car[x]; y]][(A, B);(C,D)]
 =apply[(LAMBDA,(X,Y),(CONS,(CAR,X),Y));((A,B),(C,D))] = (A,C,D)
 The S-function apply is defined by
 apply[f;args] = eval[cons[f;appq[args]];NIL],
 where
 appq[m] = [null[m] → NIL;T → cons[list[QUOTE;car[m]];appq[cdr[m]]]]
 and
 eval[e; a] = [

 Alas, the world went back to inferior character sets again—though not as far back as when
 this paper was written in early 1959.

atom [e] → assoc [e; a];

 and

 evlis[m;a] = [null[m] → NIL;T → cons[eval[car[m];a];evlis[cdr[m];a]]]
 17
We now explain a number of points about these definitions. 5
 1. apply itself forms an expression representing the value of the function
 applied to the arguments, and puts the work of evaluating this expression onto
 a function eval. It uses appq to put quotes around each of the arguments, so
 that eval will regard them as standing for themselves.
 2. eval[e;a] has two arguments, an expression e to be evaluated, and a list
 of pairs a. The first item of each pair is an atomic symbol, and the second is
 the expression for which the symbol stands.
 3. If the expression to be evaluated is atomic, eval evaluates whatever is
 paired with it first on the list a.
 4. If e is not atomic but car[e] is atomic, then the expression has one of the
 forms (QUOTE,e)or(ATOM,e)or(EQ,e1,e2)or(COND,(p1,e1),···,(pn,en)),
 or (CAR,e) or (CDR,e) or (CONS,e1,e2) or (f,e1,···,en) where f is an
 atomic symbol.
 In the case (QUOTE,e) the expression e, itself, is taken. In the case of
 (ATOM,e) or (CAR,e) or (CDR,e) the expression e is evaluated and the
 appropriate function taken. In the case of (EQ,e1,e2) or (CONS,e1,e2) two
 expressions have to be evaluated. In the case of (COND,(p1,e1),···(pn,en))
 the p’s have to be evaluated in order until a true p is found, and then the
 corresponding e must be evaluated. This is accomplished by evcon. Finally, in
 the case of (f,e1,···,en) we evaluate the expression that results from replacing
 f in this expression by whatever it is paired with in the list a.
 5. The evaluation of ((LABEL,f,E),e1,···,en) is accomplished by eval
uating (E,e1,···,en) with the pairing (f,(LABEL,f,E)) put on the front of
 the previous list a of pairs.
 6. Finally, the evaluation of ((LAMBDA,(x1,···,xn),E),e1,···en) is ac
complished by evaluating E with the list of pairs ((x1,e1),···,((xn,en)) put
 on the front of the previous list a.
 The list a could be eliminated, and LAMBDA and LABEL expressions
 evaluated by substituting the arguments for the variables in the expressions
 E. Unfortunately, difficulties involving collisions of bound variables arise, but
 they are avoided by using the list a.

 including what was actually implemented (and debugged) is given in “The Influence of the
 Designer on the Design” by Herbert Stoyan and included in Artificial Intelligence and Math

Calculating the values of functions by using apply is an activity better
 suited to electronic computers than to people. As an illustration, however, we
 now give some of the steps for calculating
 apply [(LABEL, FF, (LAMBDA, (X), (COND, (ATOM, X), X), ((QUOTE,
 T),(FF, (CAR, X))))));((A· B))] = A
 The first argument is the S-expression that represents the function ff defined
 in section 3d. We shall abbreviate it by using the letter φ. We have
 apply [φ; ( (A·B) )]
 = eval [((LABEL, FF, ψ), (QUOTE, (A·B))); NIL]
 where ψ is the part of φ beginning (LAMBDA
 = eval[((LAMBDA, (X), ω), (QUOTE, (A·B)));((FF, φ))]
 where ω is the part of ψ beginning (COND
 = eval [(COND, (π1,ϵ1),(π2,ϵ2)); ((X, (QUOTE, (A·B) ) ), (FF, φ) )]
 Denoting ((X, (QUOTE, (A·B))), (FF, φ)) by a, we obtain
 = evcon [((π1,ϵ1), (π2,ϵ2)); a]
 This involves eval [π1;a]
 = eval [( ATOM, X); a]
 = atom [eval [X; a]]
 = atom [eval [assoc [X; ((X, (QUOTE, (A·B))), (FF,φ))];a]]
 = atom [eval [(QUOTE, (A·B)); a]]
 = atom [(A·B)],
 = F
 Our main calulation continues with
 19
apply [φ; ((A·B))]
 = evcon [((π2,ϵ2,));a],
 which involves eval [π2;a] = eval [(QUOTE, T); a] = T
 Our main calculation again continues with
 apply [φ; ((A·B))]
 = eval [ϵ2;a]
 = eval [(FF, (CAR, X));a]
 = eval [Cons [φ; evlis [((CAR, X)); a]]; a]
 Evaluating evlis [((CAR, X)); a] involves
 eval [(CAR, X); a]
 = car [eval [X; a]]
 = car [(A·B)], where we took steps from the earlier computation of atom [eval [X; a]] = A,
 and so evlis [((CAR, X)); a] then becomes
 list [list [QUOTE; A]] = ((QUOTE, A)),
 and our main quantity becomes
 = eval [(φ, (QUOTE, A)); a]
 The subsequent steps are made as in the beginning of the calculation. The
 LABEL and LAMBDA cause new pairs to be added to a, which gives a new
 list of pairs a1. The π1 term of the conditional eval [(ATOM, X); a1] has the
 20
value T because X is paired with (QUOTE, A) first in a1, rather than with
 (QUOTE, (A·B)) as in a.
 Therefore we end up with eval [X; a1] from the evcon, and this is just A.
 g. Functions with Functions as Arguments. There are a number of useful
 functions some of whose arguments are functions. They are especially useful
 in defining other functions. One such function is maplist[x;f] with an S
expression argument x and an argument f that is a function from S-expressions
 to S-expressions. We define
 maplist[x;f] = [null[x] → NIL;T → cons[f[x];maplist[cdr[x];f]]]
 The usefulness of maplist is illustrated by formulas for the partial derivative
 with respect to x of expressions involving sums and products of x and other
 variables. The S-expressions that we shall differentiate are formed as follows.
 1. An atomic symbol is an allowed expression.
 2. If e1,e2,···,en are allowed expressions, ( PLUS, e1,···,en) and (TIMES,
 e1, · · ·, en) are also, and represent the sum and product, respectively, of e1,···,en.
 This is, essentially, the Polish notation for functions, except that the in
clusion of parentheses and commas allows functions of variable numbers of
 arguments. An example of an allowed expression is (TIMES, X, (PLUS, X,
 A), Y), the conventional algebraic notation for which is X(X + A)Y.
 Our differentiation formula, which gives the derivative of y with respect to
 x, is
 diff [y; x] = [atom [y] → [eq [y; x] → ONE; T → ZERO]; eq [car [Y]; PLUS]
 →cons [PLUS; maplist [cdr [y]; λ[[z]; diff [car [z]; x]]]]; eq[car [y]; TIMES] →
 cons[PLUS; maplist[cdr[y]; λ[[z]; cons [TIMES; maplist[cdr [y]; λ[[w]; ¬ eq [z;
 w] → car [w]; T → diff [car [[w]; x]]]]]]]
 The derivative of the expression (TIMES, X, (PLUS, X, A), Y), as com
puted by this formula, is
 (PLUS, (TIMES, ONE, (PLUS, X, A), Y), (TIMES, X, (PLUS, ONE,
 ZERO), Y), (TIMES, X, (PLUS, X, A), ZERO))
 Besides maplist, another useful function with functional arguments is search,
 which is defined as
 search[x;p;f;u] = [null[x] → u;p[x] → f[x];T → search[cdr[x];p;f;u]
 21
The function search is used to search a list for an element that has the property
 p, and if such an element is found, f of that element is taken. If there is no
 such element, the function u of no arguments is computed.
 4 The LISP Programming System
 The LISP programming system is a system for using the IBM 704 computer to
 compute with symbolic information in the form of S-expressions. It has been
 or will be used for the following purposes:
 l. Writing a compiler to compile LISP programs into machine language.
 2. Writing a program to check proofs in a class of formal logical systems.
 3. Writing programs for formal differentiation and integration.
 4. Writing programs to realize various algorithms for generating proofs in
 predicate calculus.
 5. Making certain engineering calculations whose results are formulas
 rather than numbers.
 6. Programming the Advice Taker system.
 The basis of the system is a way of writing computer programs to evaluate
 S-functions. This will be described in the following sections.
 In addition to the facilities for describing S-functions, there are facilities
 for using S-functions in programs written as sequences of statements along the
 lines of FORTRAN (4) or ALGOL (5). These features will not be described
 in this article.
 a. Representation of S-Expressions by List Structure. A list structure is a
 collection of computer words arranged as in figure 1a or 1b. Each word of the
 list structure is represented by one of the subdivided rectangles in the figure.
 The left box of a rectangle represents the address field of the word and the
 right box represents the decrement field. An arrow from a box to another
 rectangle means that the field corresponding to the box contains the location
 of the word corresponding to the other rectangle.
 22
An S-expression x that is not atomic is represented by a word, the address
 and decrement parts of which contain the locations of the subexpressions car[x]
 and cdr[x], respectively. If we use the symbols A, B, etc. to denote the
 locations of the association list of these symbols, then the S-expression ((A ·
 B) · (C · (E · F))) is represented by the list structure a of figure 2. Turning
 to the list form of S-expressions, we see that the S-expression (A,(B,C),D),
 which is an abbreviation for (A·((B ·(C ·NIL))·(D ·NIL))), is represented
 by the list structure of figure 2b.
 23
 It is permitted for a substructure to occur in more than one place in a list
 structure, as in figure 1b, but it is not permitted for a structure to have cycles,
 as in figure 1c. An atomic symbol is represented in the computer by a list
 structure of special form called the association list of the symbol. The address
 f
 ield of the first word contains a special constant which enables the program to
 tell that this word represents an atomic symbol. We shall describe association
 lists in section 4b.--

 When a list structure is regarded as representing a list, we see that each term
 of the list occupies the address part of a word, the decrement part of which
 points to the word containing the next term, while the last word has NIL in
 its decrement.
 An expression that has a given subexpression occurring more than once
 can be represented in more than one way. Whether the list structure for
 the subexpression is or is not repeated depends upon the history of the pro
gram. Whether or not a subexpression is repeated will make no difference
 in the results of a program as they appear outside the machine, although it
 will affect the time and storage requirements. For example, the S-expression
 ((A·B)·(A·B)) can be represented by either the list structure of figure 3a or
 3b.----
 A B AB

 Figure 3
 The prohibition against circular list structures is essentially a prohibition
 24
against an expression being a subexpression of itself. Such an expression could
 not exist on paper in a world with our topology. Circular list structures would
 have some advantages in the machine, for example, for representing recursive
 functions, but difficulties in printing them, and in certain other operations,
 make it seem advisable not to use them for the present.
 The advantages of list structures for the storage of symbolic expressions
 are:
 1. The size and even the number of expressions with which the program
 will have to deal cannot be predicted in advance. Therefore, it is difficult to
 arrange blocks of storage of fixed length to contain them.
 2. Registers can be put back on the free-storage list when they are no longer
 needed. Even one register returned to the list is of value, but if expressions
 are stored linearly, it is difficult to make use of blocks of registers of odd sizes
 that may become available.
 3. An expression that occurs as a subexpression of several expressions need
 be represented in storage only once.
 b. Association Lists6 . In the LISP programming system we put more in
 the association list of a symbol than is required by the mathematical system
 described in the previous sections. In fact, any information that we desire to
 associate with the symbol may be put on the association list. This information
 may include: the print name, that is, the string of letters and digits which
 represents the symbol outside the machine; a numerical value if the symbol
 represents a number; another S-expression if the symbol, in some way, serves
 as a name for it; or the location of a routine if the symbol represents a function
 for which there is a machine-language subroutine. All this implies that in the
 machine system there are more primitive entities than have been described in
 the sections on the mathematical system.
 For the present, we shall only describe how print names are represented
 on association lists so that in reading or printing the program can establish
 a correspondence between information on punched cards, magnetic tape or
 printed page and the list structure inside the machine. The association list of
 the symbol DIFFERENTIATE has a segment of the form shown in figure 4.
 Here pname is a symbol that indicates that the structure for the print name
 of the symbol whose association list this is hanging from the next word on
 the association list. In the second row of the figure we have a list of three
 words. The address part of each of these words points to a Word containing
 61995: These were later called property lists.
 25
six 6-bit characters. The last word is filled out with a 6-bit combination that
 does not represent a character printable by the computer. (Recall that the
 IBM 7O4 has a 36-bit word and that printable characters are each represented
 by 6 bits.) The presence of the words with character information means that
 the association lists do not themselves represent S-expressions, and that only
 some of the functions for dealing with S-expressions make sense within an
 association list.

 c. Free-Storage List. At any given time only a part of the memory reserved
 for list structures will actually be in use for storing S-expressions. The remain
ing registers (in our system the number, initially, is approximately 15,000) are
 arranged in a single list called the free-storage list. A certain register, FREE,
 in the program contains the location of the first register in this list. When
 a word is required to form some additional list structure, the first word on
 the free-storage list is taken and the number in register FREE is changed to
 become the location of the second word on the free-storage list. No provision
 need be made for the user to program the return of registers to the free-storage
 list.
 This return takes place automatically, approximately as follows (it is nec
essary to give a simplified description of this process in this report): There is
 a fixed set of base registers in the program which contains the locations of list
 structures that are accessible to the program. Of course, because list struc
tures branch, an arbitrary number of registers may be involved. Each register
 that is accessible to the program is accessible because it can be reached from
 one or more of the base registers by a chain of car and cdr operations. When
 26
the contents of a base register are changed, it may happen that the register
 to which the base register formerly pointed cannot be reached by a car − cdr
 chain from any base register. Such a register may be considered abandoned
 by the program because its contents can no longer be found by any possible
 program; hence its contents are no longer of interest, and so we would like to
 have it back on the free-storage list. This comes about in the following way.
 Nothing happens until the program runs out of free storage. When a free
 register is wanted, and there is none left on the free-storage list, a reclamation7
 cycle starts.
 First, the program finds all registers accessible from the base registers and
 makes their signs negative. This is accomplished by starting from each of the
 base registers and changing the sign of every register that can be reached from
 it by a car − cdr chain. If the program encounters a register in this process
 which already has a negative sign, it assumes that this register has already
 been reached.
 After all of the accessible registers have had their signs changed, the pro
gramgoes through the area of memory reserved for the storage of list structures
 and puts all the registers whose signs were not changed in the previous step
 back on the free-storage list, and makes the signs of the accessible registers
 positive again.
 This process, because it is entirely automatic, is more convenient for the
 programmer than a system in which he has to keep track of and erase un
wanted lists. Its efficiency depends upon not coming close to exhausting the
 available memory with accessible lists. This is because the reclamation process
 requires several seconds to execute, and therefore must result in the addition
 of at least several thousand registers to the free-storage list if the program is
 not to spend most of its time in reclamation.
 d. Elementary S-Functions in the Computer. We shall now describe the
 computer representations of atom, = , car, cdr, and cons. An S-expression
 is communicated to the program that represents a function as the location of
 the word representing it, and the programs give S-expression answers in the
 same form.
 atom. As stated above, a word representing an atomic symbol has a special
 7We already called this process “garbage collection”, but I guess I chickened out of using
 it in the paper—or else the Research Laboratory of Electronics grammar ladies wouldn’t let
 me.
 27
constant in its address part: atom is programmed as an open subroutine that
 tests this part. Unless the M-expression atom[e] occurs as a condition in a
 conditional expression, the symbol T or F is generated as the result of the
 test. In case of a conditional expression, a conditional transfer is used and the
 symbol T or F is not generated.
 eq. The program for eq[e;f] involves testing for the numerical equality of
 the locations of the words. This works because each atomic symbol has only
 one association list. As with atom, the result is either a conditional transfer
 or one of the symbols T or F.
 car. Computing car[x] involves getting the contents of the address part of
 register x. This is essentially accomplished by the single instruction CLA 0, i,
 where the argument is in index register, and the result appears in the address
 part of the accumulator. (We take the view that the places from which a
 function takes its arguments and into which it puts its results are prescribed
 in the definition of the function, and it is the responsibility of the programmer
 or the compiler to insert the required datamoving instructions to get the results
 of one calculation in position for the next.) (“car” is a mnemonic for “contents
 of the address part of register.”)
 cdr. cdr is handled in the same way as car, except that the result appears
 in the decrement part of the accumulator (“cdr” stands for “contents of the
 decrement part of register.”)
 cons. The value of cons[x;y] must be the location of a register that has x
 and y in its address and decrement parts, respectively. There may not be such
 a register in the computer and, even if there were, it would be time-consuming
 to find it. Actually, what we do is to take the first available register from the
 free-storage list, put x and y in the address and decrement parts, respectively,
 and make the value of the function the location of the register taken. (“cons”
 is an abbreviation for “construct.”)
 It is the subroutine for cons that initiates the reclamation when the free
storage list is exhausted. In the version of the system that is used at present
 cons is represented by a closed subroutine. In the compiled version, cons is
 open.
 e. Representation of S-Functions by Programs. The compilation of func
tions that are compositions of car, cdr, and cons, either by hand or by a
 compiler program, is straightforward. Conditional expressions give no trouble
 except that they must be so compiled that only the p’s and e’s that are re
28
quired are computed. However, problems arise in the compilation of recursive
 functions.
 In general (we shall discuss an exception), the routine for a recursive func
tion uses itself as a subroutine. For example, the program for subst[x;y;z] uses
 itself as a subroutine to evaluate the result of substituting into the subexpres
sions car[z] and cdr[z]. While subst[x;y;cdr[z]] is being evaluated, the result
 of the previous evaluation of subst[x;y;car[z]] must be saved in a temporary
 storage register. However, subst may need the same register for evaluating
 subst[x; y;cdr[z]]. This possible conflict is resolved by the SAVE and UN
SAVE routines that use the public push-down list 8. The SAVE routine is
 entered at the beginning of the routine for the recursive function with a re
quest to save a given set of consecutive registers. A block of registers called
 the public push-down list is reserved for this purpose. The SAVE routine has
 an index that tells it how many registers in the push-down list are already
 in use. It moves the contents of the registers which are to be saved to the
 f
 irst unused registers in the push-down list, advances the index of the list, and
 returns to the program from which control came. This program may then
 freely use these registers for temporary storage. Before the routine exits it
 uses UNSAVE, which restores the contents of the temporary registers from
 the push-down list and moves back the index of this list. The result of these
 conventions is described, in programming terminology, by saying that the re
cursive subroutine is transparent to the temporary storage registers.
 f. Status of the LISP Programming System (February 1960). A variant of
 the function apply described in section 5f has been translated into a program
 APPLY for the IBM 704. Since this routine can compute values of S-functions
 given their descriptions as S-expressions and their arguments, it serves as an
 interpreter for the LISP programming language which describes computation
 processes in this way.
 The program APPLY has been imbedded in the LISP programming system
 which has the following features:
 1. The programmer maydefine anynumber ofS-functions by S-expressions.
 these functions may refer to each other or to certain S-functions represented
 by machine language program.
 2. The values of defined functions may be computed.
 3. S-expressions may be read and printed (directly or via magnetic tape).
 81995: now called a stack
 29
4. Some error diagnostic and selective tracing facilities are included.
 5. The programmer may have selected S-functions compiled into machine
 language programs put into the core memory. Values of compiled functions
 are computed about 60 times as fast as they would if interpreted. Compilation
 is fast enough so that it is not necessary to punch compiled program for future
 use.
 6. A “program feature” allows programs containing assignment and go to
 statements in the style of ALGOL.
 7. Computation with floating point numbers is possible in the system, but
 this is inefficient.
 8. A programmer’s manual is being prepared. The LISP programming
 system is appropriate for computations where the data can conveniently be
 represented as symbolic expressions allowing expressions of the same kind as
 subexpressions. A version of the system for the IBM 709 is being prepared.
 5 Another Formalism for Functions of Sym
bolic Expressions
 There are a number of ways of defining functions of symbolic expressions which
 are quite similar to the system we have adopted. Each of them involves three
 basic functions, conditional expressions, and recursive function definitions, but
 the class of expressions corresponding to S-expressions is different, and so are
 the precise definitions of the functions. We shall describe one of these variants
 called linear LISP.
 The L-expressions are defined as follows:
 1. A finite list of characters is admitted.
 2. Any string of admitted characters in an L-expression. This includes the
 null string denoted by Λ.
 There are three functions of strings:
 1. first[x] is the first character of the string x.
 first[Λ] is undefined. For example: first[ABC] = A
 2. rest[x] is the string of characters which remains when the first character
 of the string is deleted.
 rest[Λ] is undefined. For example: rest[ABC] = BC.
 3. combine[x;y] is the string formed by prefixing the character x to the
 string y. For example: combine[A;BC] = ABC
 30
There are three predicates on strings:
 1. char[x], x is a single character.
 2. null[x], x is the null string.
 3. x =y, defined for x and y characters.
 The advantage of linear LISP is that no characters are given special roles,
 as are parentheses, dots, and commas in LISP. This permits computations
 with all expressions that can be written linearly. The disadvantage of linear
 LISP is that the extraction of subexpressions is a fairly involved, rather than
 an elementary, operation. It is not hard to write, in linear LISP, functions that
 correspond to the basic functions of LISP, so that, mathematically, linear LISP
 includes LISP. This turns out to be the most convenient way of programming,
 in linear LISP, the more complicated manipulations. However, if the functions
 are to be represented by computer routines, LISP is essentially faster.
 6 Flowcharts and Recursion
 Since both the usual form of computer program and recursive function defi
nitions are universal computationally, it is interesting to display the relation
 between them. The translation of recursive symbolic functions into computer
 programs was the subject of the rest of this report. In this section we show
 how to go the other way, at least in principle.
 The state of the machine at any time during a computation is given by the
 values of a number of variables. Let these variables be combined into a vector
 ξ. Consider a program block with one entrance and one exit. It defines and is
 essentially defined by a certain function f that takes one machine configuration
 into another, that is, f has the form ξ′ = f(ξ). Let us call f the associated
 function of the program block. Now let a number of such blocks be combined
 into a program by decision elements π that decide after each block is completed
 which block will be entered next. Nevertheless, let the whole program still have
 one entrance and one exit.

 Wegive as an example the flowcart of figure 5. Let us describe the function
 r[ξ] that gives the transformation of the vector ξ between entrance and exit
 of the whole block. We shall define it in conjunction with the functions s(ξ),
 and t[ξ], which give the transformations that ξ undergoes between the points
 S and T, respectively, and the exit. We have
 r[ξ] = [π11[ξ] → S[f1[ξ]];T → S[f2[ξ]]]
 S[ξ] = [π21[ξ] → r[ξ];T → t[f3[ξ]]]
 t[ξ] = [π3I[ξ] → f4[ξ];π32[ξ] → r[ξ];T → t[f3[ξ]]]
 Given a flowchart with a single entrance and a single exit, it is easy to
 write down the recursive function that gives the transformation of the state
 vector from entrance to exit in terms of the corresponding functions for the
 computation blocks and the predicates of the branch. In general, we proceed
 as follows.
 In figure 6, let β be an n-way branch point, and let f1,···,fn be the
 computations leading to branch points β1,β2,···,βn. Let φ be the function

Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions 
Their Computation by Machine, Part I 
John McCarthytts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. 
1. 
Introduction 
A programming system called LISP (for lASt Processor) 
has been developed for the IBM 704 computer by the 
Artificial Intelligence group at M.I.T. The system was 
designed to facilitate experiments with a proposed system 
called the Advice Taker, whereby a machine could be 
instructed to handle declarative as well as imperative 
sentences and could exhibit "common sense" in carrying 
out its instructions. The original proposal It] for the Advice 
Taker was made in November 1958. The main require- 
ment was a programming system for manipulating ex- 
pressions representing formalized declarative and irnpera- 
live sentences so that the Advice Taker system could make 
deductions. 
In the course of its development the Lisp system went 
through several stages of simplification and eventually 
came to be based on a scheme for representing the partial 
recursive functions of a certain class of symbolic expres- 
sions. This representation is independent of the IBM 704 
computer, or of any other electronic computer, and it now 
seems expedient to expound the system by starting with 
the class of expressions called S-expressions and the func- 
tions called S-functions. 
In this article, we first describe a formalism for defining 
functions reeursively. We believe this formalism has ad- 
vantages both as a programming language and as vehicle 
for developing a theory of computation. Next, we describe 
S-expressions and S-functions, give some examples, and 
then describe the universM S-function apply which plays 
the theoretical role of a universal Turing machine and 
the practical role of an interpreter. Then we describe the 
representation of S-expressions in the memmT of the 
IBM 704 by list structures similar to those used by Newell, 
Shaw and Simon [2], and the representation of S-functions 
by program. Then we mention the main features of the 
Lisp programming system for the IBM 704. Next comes 
another way of describing computations with symbolic 
expressions, and finally we give a recursive function in- 
terpretation of flow charts. 
We hope to describe some of the sylnbolie computations 
for which LISP has been used in another paper, and also to 
give elsewhere some applications of our reeursive function 
formalism to mathematical logic and to the problem of 
mechanical theorem proving. 
and 
2. Functions and Function Definitions 
We shMl need a number of mathematical ideas ar:d 
notations concerning functions in general. Most of the 
ideas are well known, but the notion of conditional e,~pre~'- 
sion is believed to be new, and ihe use of conditional 
expressions permits functions to be defined recursively in a 
new and convenient way. 
a. Partial Functions. A partial function is a funct on 
that is defined only on part of its domain. Partial funetio:~s 
necessarily arise when functions are defined by eomputa~ 
tions because for some values of the arguments t:he Pomp:> 
ration defining the value of the function may not ter- 
minate. However, some of our elementary functions wilt be 
defined as partial functions. 
b. Propositional Expres.s'ions and Predicates. A t)ropo~i- 
tionM expression is an expression whose possible values 
are T (for truth) and F (for falsity). We shall assume 
that the reader is fanfiliar with the propositionM eom~ee- 
lives A ("and"), V ("or"), and ~ ("not"), Typieai 
propositional expressions are: 
x<y 
(x < y) A (b = e) 
x is prime 
A predicate is a function whose range consists of ih{: 
truth values T and F. 
e. Conditional Expressions. The dependence of truth 
values on the vahtes of quantities of other kinds is ex- 
pressed in mathematics by predicates, and the depende~ee 
of truth values on other truth values by logical comxee- 
~ives. However, the notations for expressing symbol (alE" 
the dependence of quantities of other kinds on trutt~ 
vMues is inadequate, so that English words and phrases 
are generMly used for expressing these depende~tces i:~ 
texts that, describe other dependences symbolically. I!'<~r 
example, the function Ix I is ustmlly defined in words. 
Conditional expressions are a deviee for expressing the 
dependence of quantities on propositional quantities. :\ 
conditional expression has the form 
(p: -+ el, -.- , p~ --+ e,,) 
where the p's are propositionM expressions and the e's are 
expressions of any kind. It may be read, "If p~ thexx <, 
184 
Communications of the ACM 
,iherwise if p2 then e2, - - • , otherwise if p,, then e,, ," or 
..p~ y/el(Is e3 , "" , P,, yields e,, ." 
We now give the rules :for determining whether the value 
r,f !p, --' e,, .,' , p,, --' e,) is defined, and if so what its 
value is. Examine the p's from left. to right. If a p whose 
valu~ is T is eilcountered before any p whose vahm is 
~mdefilied is eneom~tered, then the value of the conditional 
,xpressi(m is the value of the corresponding e (if this is 
left ned). If airy undefined p is ene(:mntered before a true p, 
.r if all p's are false, or if the e corresponding to the first 
true p is undefined, then the value of the conditional ex- 
pression is undefined. We now give examples.

Some of tile simplest applications of eonditionM expres- 
sia~s are in giving such definitions as 
x 
= 
(x < 0--,-x, iF--~x) 
san x ~ (x <0--,-1, 
x 
== 0--~0, T-~I) 
d. Rccursive Function DefiniHons. By using conditionM 
~:,xpressions we can, without circularity, define functions 
,v formulas in which the defined function occurs. For 
{'xample, we wrile 
l~: = (n = 0-~ 1, T--*n.(n- 
1)1) 
When we use this formula to evaluate 0 [ we get the answer 
i: because of the way in which the value of a conditional 
expression 
was defined, the meaningless expression 
~]- ~} - 
r, 
1)! does not arise. The evaluation of 2! according 
lhi:~ definition proceeds as follows: 
2! - - 
(2 = 0-* 1, T--.2.(2 
2.1! 
= 2.(1 = 0~L -

= 
= 
2-1-0! -.1.(0 
=2.1.1 
=2 
= 
0-~I,T-~0.(0- 
1)!) 
We now give two other applications of recursive func- 
tion definitions. The greatest common divisor, gcd(m,n), 
of ~wc, positive integers m and n is computed by means of 
the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is expressed by 
the recursive function defirfition: 
ged(m,n) = (In > n --, ged(n,m), rem(n,m) 
= 0 -+ m, T --* ged(rem(n,m),m) ) 
where rein(n, In) denotes the remainder left when n is 
divided by m. 
The Newtonian algorithm for obtaining an approximate 
square root of a number a, starting with an initial approxi- 
mation :v and requiring that an acceptable approximation 
y satisfy l y 2 -- a I < e, may be written as 
sqrt(a, x, ~) 
= 
(Ix ~- a I < e--,x,T-~sqrt (a,~ 
1 (x + ~) e)) 
x ' 
The simultaneous reeursive definition of several func- 
tions is also possible, and we shall use such definitions if 
they are required. 
There is no guarantee that tile computation determined 
by a reeursive definition will ever terminate and, for 
example, an attempt to compute n[ from our definition 
will only succeed if n is a non-negative integer. If the com- 
putation does not terminate, the function must be regarded 
as undefined for the given arguments. 
The propositional connectives themselves can be de- 
fined by conditional expressions. We write 
p/~q= 
(p --~ q, T --~ F) 
pVq = (p -~ T, T -* q) 
~-~p = (p-~F,T--~T) 
p D q = (p-~q, T-~T) 
It is readily seen that the right-hand sides of the equa- 
tions have the correct truth tables. If we consider situa- 
tions in which p or q may be undefined, the connectives 
/~ and V are seen to be; noncommutative. For example if 
p is false and q is undefined, we see that according to the 
definitions given above p A q is false, but q A p is unde- 
fined. For our applications this noncommutativity is 
desirable, since p /~ q is computed by first computing p, 
and if p is false q is not computed. :If the computation for 
p does not terminate, we never get around to computing q. 
We shall use propositional connectives in this sense here- 
after. 
e. Functions and Forms. It is usual in mathematics-- 
outside of mathematical logic--to use the word "function" 
imprecisely and to apply it to forms such as y~ -V x. Be- 
cause we shall later compute with expressions for functions, 
we need a distinction between functions and forms and a 
notation for expressing this distinction. This distinction 
and a notation for describing it, from which we deviate 
trivially, is given by Church [3]. 
Let f be an expression that stands for a function of two 
integer variables. It should make sense to write f(3, 4) and 
the value of this expression should be determined. The 
expression y~ + x does not meet this requirement;

In order to be able to write expressio~s for I'eCursive

We shall first define a class of symbolic express ~ s :i~ 
terms of ordered pairs and lists. Then we shall define five, g 
elementary functions and predicates, and build front them ~i' 
by composition, conditional expressions, and "(ru,sv~:, 
definitions an extensive class of functions of which w~ ; 
sh'dl give a number of examples. We shall lhen show how 
these functions themselves can be expressed as syr~bol c 
expressions, and we shah define a universal ftlllCtiOtt

define some functions with functions as argume~ts :u~d ill'

a. A Class qf S!]nzbolic Expressions. We shall now <te{i~+~, { 
y~ + x(3, 4) is not a conventional no~ati(m, and if we 
attempted to define it we would be uneert%ir~ whether its 
valtte would turn out, to be i13 or 1.9. Church calls a,n expres- 
sion like ye + x a form. A form can be eot~verted into a 
ftmetion if we can determine the, eorrespondenee between 
the variables occurring in the form and the ordered list of 
arguments of the desired function. This is accomplished 
by Church's X-flotation. 
If ~;is ~ form in variables xl , -.. , x~,, then X((xt , ,.. , 
x,,), ~;) will t:>(:~ taken to be the function of n variables whose 
value is determned by substituting the arguments for lhe 
variables x~, • • - , x~, in that order in g and evaluating the 
resulting expression. For example, X((x,y),ye+x) is a 
function of two variables, and X ( (x, y), y~ +x) (3, 4:) - 19. 
The variables occurring in the list of variables of a X-ex- 
pression are dummy or bound, like, variables of integration 
in a definite integral. That is, we may change the names 
of the bound w~riables in a function expression without 
changing the vMue of the expression, provided that we 
make tile same change for each occurrence of the wu'iable 
and do not make two variM)les lhe same that previously 
were different. Thus X((x,y),y"'+x),X((u,v), v~+u) and 
X((y, x), xe+y) denote the same function. 
We shall frequently use expressions in which some of the 
wmables are bound by X's and others are not. Such art ex- 
pression may be regarded as defining a function with 
parameters. The unbound variables are (;ailed free vari- 
ables. 
An adequate notation that distinguishes functions from 
forms allows an unambiguous treatnmnt of functions of 
ftmetions. It, would involve too much of a digression to give 
examples here, but we shall use functions with functions as 
arguments later in this report. 
Difticulties arise in combining functions described by 
X-expressions, or by arty other notation involving variables, 
because different bound variables may be represented by 
the same symbol. This is called collision of bound vari- 
ables. There is a notation involving operators that are 
called eombinators for combining functions without the use 
of variables, Unfortunately, the combinatory expressions 
for interesting combinations of functions term to be lengthy 
and unreadable. 
f. 
Expressions for Recursive Functions. The X-notation is 
inadequate for naming functions defined recursively. For 
example, using X's, we can convert the definition 
sqrt(a, x, e) 
J. 
a 
( ix" -- a I < e -~ x, T -~ sqrt(a, 2(x + x ), e)) 
into 
sqrt = X((a,x,¢),(lx 2 -- a,l < e---+ x, T'---~ 
i 
a) 
sqrt (a, 2(x + x ' 
+))) 
but the right-hand side cannot serve as an expression for 
the fimetion because there would be nothing to indicate 
186 
the S-expressions (S st'rods for symbolic). They are for ~ed :' 
by ttsittg the special chara(.ters 
) 
( 
and an infinite set of distinguishable atomic symbols. For 
atomic symbols, we shall use strings of capital l,atin lette~ 
and digits with single imbedded blanks. Ex'm@es *~f 
atomic symbols are 
A 
ABA 
APPLE PIE NUMBER 3 
There is a twofold reason for departing from the usual 
mathematieM practice of using single letters for atomic 
synlbols. First, computer programs frequently requir<' 
hundreds of distinguishable symbols thai, nmst be formed 
from the 47 characters that are printable by the IBM 7N 
computer. Second, it is convenient to allow English wo~ds 
and phrases to stand for atomic entities for mnem(mic 
reasons. The symbols are atomic in the sense that any sui:- 
structure they may have as sequences of characters is it, 
nored. We assume only that= different symbols cam be 
distinguished.

S-expressi(>ns are th.el~ defined as follows: 
1. M()mic symbols are S-expressions° 
i?. If e~ alld e.., are S-expressions, so is (el'e2). 
Examples of S-expressions are 
AB 
(~v. B) 
(tAB.O)-D) 
An S-expression is then simply an ordered pair, the 
wrms of which may be atomic symbols or simpler S-expres- 
si,ms. We can represent a tist of arbitrary length in terms 
<>f S-expressions as follows. The list 
) 
: 
(m~, me, "'" ,m,,) 
is represented by the S-expression 
(m t-imp'( .... (m,,-N[L)...))) 
ilere NIL is an atomic symbol used to terminate lists. 
Si~me many of the symbolic expressions with which we 
de:~.l are conveniently expressed as lists, we shall introduce 
a lis~ imtation to abbreviate certain S-expressions. We have 
1. im) siands for (re.NIL). 
2. (m~ ,., . , m,) stands for (ml. (. -. (m,.NIL)- .-)). 
'.~. (m,, -.- , m,,.x) stands :for (mr' (---(m,,.x)... )). 
Subexpressions can be similarly abbreviated. Some 
examples of these abbreviations are 
{(AB, C), l)) for ((AB-(C-NIL)).(D.NIL)) 
(~A,B),C, I).E) for ((A.(B-NIL)).(C.(D.E))) 
Nince we regard the expressions with commas as abbre- 
viation,s for those not involving commas, we shall refer to 
~hem all as S-expressions. 
b. ["~mc~ions of S-expressions and the Expressions 77~at 
t~q,'~,~ent Them. We now define a class of functions of 
S-expressions. The expressions representing these ftmc- 
~io~s are written in a conventional functional notation. 
tIowever, in order to clearly distinguish the expressions 
rvpresenting fmmtions from S:expressions, we shall use 
~quences of lower-case letters for function names and 
variabk~s ravaging over the set of S-expressions. We also 
~ 
brackets and semicolons, instead of parentheses and 
commas, for denoting the application of functions to their 
arguments. Thus we write 
car [x] 
car [cons [(A.B); x]] 
I~ these M-expressions (meta.-expressions) any S-expres- 
sions that oeetlr stand for themselves. 
e, The tflemerttary S:functions and Predicates. We intro- 
<t~ee the following functions and predicates: 
L atom. 
atom [x] has the value of T or F, accordingly 
as x is an atomic symbol or not. Thus 
atom IX] = T 
atom [iX.A)] = F 
2. eq. 
eq Ix; 3'] is defined if "rod only if both x and y 
are atomic, eq Ix; y] = T if x and y are the same symbol, 
and eq Ix; Yl = F otherwise. Thus 
eq [X; X] = T 
eq IX; A] = F 
eq [X; (X.A)] is undefined. 
3. ear. 
car Ix] is defined if "rod only if x is not atomic. 
car [(e~.ee)] = el. Thus car [XI is undefined. 
car [(X.A)I = X 
ear [((X.A).Y)] = iX.A) 
4. edr. 
cdr Ix] is also defined when x is not atomic. 
We have cdr [(<'e~)l = <. Thus edr {X] is undefined. 
cdr [(X.A)] = A 
edr [((X.A)-Y)] =: 55 
5. cons. 
cons Ix; y] is defined for any x and y. We 
have cons [e~ ; e~] = (e1.e~). Thus 
cons [X; A1 = iX. A) 
cons [iX.A); Y] = ((X-A).Y) 
ear, cdr, and cons ,~i'e easily seen to satisfy the relations 
ear [cons [x; y]] = x 
cdr [cons {x; y]] = y 
cons [car [x]; cdr [x/1 = x, provided that x is not. atomic. 
The nantes "car" and "cons" will come to have mne- 
monic significance only when we discuss the representation 
of the system in the computer. Compositions of car and cdr 
give the subexpressions of a given expression in a given 
position. Compositions of cons form expressions of a given 
structure out of paris. The class of functions which can be 
formed in this way is quite limited and not very interesting. 
d. Recur,s@e S-functions. We gel; a nmch larger class of 
functions (in fact, all computable functions) when we 
allow ourselves to form new functions of S-expressions by 
conditional expressions and recursive definition. 
We now give some examples of functions that are de- 
finable in this way. 
1. ff [x]. 
The value of ff Ix] is the first atomic symbol 
of the S-expression x with the parentheses ignored. Thus 
ff [((A.B).C)] 
We have 
= 
a 
ff [x] = [atom [x] -~ x; T --~ff [ear [x]]l 
We now tract in detail the steps in the evaluation of 
ff [((A.B),C)]: 
ff [((A.B).C)] 
= [atom [((A.B).C)]--~ ((A.B)-C); 
T--~ ff lear [((A.B)'C)lll 
= iF "-+ ((A.B).C);T 
= -~f'f [ear [((A-B).C)]]] 
[T --~ t'f (ear I((A.B)"C)111 
Communications of the ACM

= ff [ear [((A.B).C)]] 
: 
= 
= 
= 
ff [(A.B)] 
[atom [(A.B)] -+ (A.B); T --> ff [ear [(A.B)]]] 
[F + (A.B); T -~ff [eat" [(m.*{)]]] 
[T --+ff [car [(A.B)]]] 
= ff lear [(A.B)]] 
: 
ff [A] 
= 
= 
[atom [A] --~ A; T --+ ff [ear [A]]] 
[T ~ A; T --, ff [car [A]]] 
=A 
2. subst Ix; y; z]. 
This function gives the result of 
substituting the S-expression x for all occurrences of the 
atomic symbol y in the S-expression z. It is defined by 
subst Ix; y; z] = [atom [z] --+ [eq [z; y] -+ x; T --~ z]; 
T + cons [subst Ix; y; ear [z]]; subst Ix; y; edr [z]l]] 
As an example, we have 
subst [(X.A); B; ((A-B)-C)] = ((A-(X.A))-C) 
3. equal [x; y]. 
This is a predicate that has the value 
T if x and y are the same S-expression, and has the value 
I v otherwise. We have 
equal Ix; y] = [atom [x]/~ atom [y] /~ eq Ix; y]] 
V [~-oatom [x] /~ ~atom [y] /~ equal lear [x]; car [y]] 
It is convenient to see how the elementary functions 
look in the abbreviated list notation. The reader will 
easily verify that 
(i) ear [(ml, m2, ... , m,)] = ml 
(ii) 
edr [(m,, m2, "" , m~)] = (m2, .." , m~) 
(iii) cdr [(m)] = NIL 
(iv) cons[m,;(m2,'",m,,)] 
(v) cons [m; NIL] = (m) 
We define 
null [x] = atom [x] A eq [x; NIL] 
This predicate is useful in dealing with lists. 
Compositions of ear and edr arise so frequently that 
many expressions can be written more concisely if we 
abbreviate 
eadr [x] for ear [edr [x]], 
eaddr [x] for ear [edr [edr [x]]], etc. 
Another useful abbreviation isto write list [e~ ; e= ; • • • ; e~] 
for cons [el ; cons [e2 ; • • • ; cons [e. ; NIL]-. • ]]. This func- 
tion gives the list, (e,, ..- , e.), as a hmetion of its ele- 
ments. 
188 
The following functions are useful when S-expressior~s 
are regarded as lists. 
1. append [x; y]. 
append Ix; y] = [mdI [x] -+ y; T ~ cons [ca," [x]; 
append [cdr [x]; y]]] 
An example is 
append [(A, B); (C, l), E)] = (A, B, C, D, ]i;) 
2. among [x; y]. 
This predicate is true if the S-ex- 
pression x occurs among the elements of the lis~ y. We have 
among Ix; y] = ~--mull [y] /~ [equal [x; ear [y]] 
V among [x; cdr D']]] 
3. pair Ix; y]. 
This function gives the list of pairs of 
corresponding elements of the lists x and y, We have 
pair Ix; y] = [null [x]/\ null [y] -+ NIL; --,atom [xl 
/~ ~-~atom [y] -+ cons [lisg lear Ix]; ear [y]]; 
pair [edr Ix]; cdr [y]]]] 
An example is 
pair [(A, B, C); (X, (Y, Z), U)] = ((A, X), 
(B, (Y, Z)), (C, C)) 
4. assoe [x;y]. 
/~ equal [edr [x]; edr [yl]l 
If y is a list of the form ((ut, v,), 
• • • , (m~, v~) ) and x is one of the u's, then assoe [x; Yl is 
the corresponding v. We have 
assoc [x; y] = ecl[caar [y]; x] -+ eadar [y] ; 
T --~ assoc Ix; ode [y}]] 
An example is 
assoe IX; ((W, (A, B)), (X, (C, D)), 
(Y, (E, F)))] : (C, ~)) 
5. sublis [x; y]. 
= 
(ml,m~,'",m,,) 
Here x is assumed to have the form 
of a list of pairs ((u~, v,), • .. , (u,,, v,)), where the u% 
are atomic, and y may be any S-expression. The value of 
sublis [x; y] is tile result of substituting each v for the cor- 
responding u in y. In order to define sublis, we first defi~e 
an auxiliary function. We have 
sub2 [x; z] = [null Ix] -+ z; eq [eaar [x]; z] ~ eadar [x]; 
T -+ sub2 [cdr [x]; z]] 
and 
sublis Ix; Yl = [atom [y] --~ sub2 [x; y]; 
T ~ cons [sublis [x; ear [y]]; sublis [x; edr [y]i] 
We have 
sublis [((X, (A, B)), (Y, (B, C))); (A, X.Y)] 
= (a, (a, B), B, c)

e. R~¢prese,zlation of S-Functions by S-Expressions. 
S.func[ions have bem~ described by M-expressions. We 
now give a rule for t, ranslating M-expressions into S- 
expressions, ii, order to be able to use S-functions for 
making certain computations with S-functions and for 
aaswering certain questions about S-functions. 
The translation is determined by the following rules in 
which we denote ~he translation of an M-expression 8 by 
1. If g is an S-expression E* is (QUOTE, 8). 
2. Variables and function names that were represented 
by strings of lower-case letters are translated to the cor- 
responding strings of the corresponding upper-case letters. 
Thus car* is CAR, and subst* is SUBST. 
3. A form fie, ; . • • ; en] is translated to (f*, e~*, • - • , en*). 
Thus {cons {ear [x]; edr [x]l}* is (CONS, (CAR, X), 
CDR, X)). 
4. {[p, -+ e, ; ... ; p,, -+ e,]}* is (COND, (p**, e**), 
.., (p,,*. e,,*)). 
5. {X[[x, ; .." ; x,]; g]}* is (LAMBDA, (x~*, --- , x,,*), 
~;*). 
6. {label [a; a]}* is (LABEL, a*, g*). 
With these conventions the substitution function whose 
M-expression is label [subst; X[[x; y; z]; [atom [z] -+ 
[eq [y; z] -~, x; T --~ z]; T --~ cons [subst [x; y; ear [z]]; 
subst Ix; y; cdr [z]]]]l] has the S-expression 
(LABEL, SUEST, (I.MMI~DA, (X, Y, Z), (COND 
((ATOM, Z), (COND, (EQ, Y, Z), X), ((QUOTE, 
T), Z))), ((QUOTE, T), (CONS, (SUBST, X, Y, 
(CAI~ Z)), (SUBST, X, Y, (CDR, Z))))))) 
This notation is writable and somewhat readable. It can 
be made easier tO read and write at the cost of making its 
structure less regular. If more characters were available 
on the computer, it could be improved considerably. 
f. 
The Universal S-Function apply. There is an S-func- 
tion apply with the property that if f is an S-expression for 
art S-function f' and args is a list of arguments of the form 
(argl, ... , argn), where argl, ..', argn are arbitrary 
S-expressions, then apply{f; args] and f'[argl; .." ; argn] 
arc defined for the same vahms of argl, ... , argn, and are 
equal when defined. For example, 
X[[x; y]; cons [car [x]; yl] [(A, B); (C, D)] 
= apply [(LAMBDA, (X, Y), (CONS, (CAR, X), 
y)); ((A, B), (C, D))] = (A, C, D) 
The S-function apply is defined by 
apply If; args]= eval [cons If; appq [args]]; NIL] 
where 
appq [m] = {null [m] -+ NIL; 
T -~ cons {list [QUOTE; car [m]]; appq [cdr [m]]]] 
and, 
eval [e; a] = [ 
atom [e] --+ assoc [e; a]; 
atom [car [e]] --+ [ 
eq {ear [e]; QUOTE] -~ cadr [e]; 
eq [car [e]; ATOM] -÷ atom [eval [cadr [e]; a]]; 
eq [cal" [e]; EQ] --~ [eval [cadr [e]; a] = eval [cad& [e]; a]]; 
eq [car {el; CON])] --~ evcon [edr [e]; a]; 
eq [ear" [e]; CAR] --~ ear [eval [cadr [el; a]]; 
eq [car [e]; CDR] --~ cdr [eval [cadr [e]; a]]; 
eq [car {el; CONS] --~ cons [eval [eadr {el; a]; eval [eaddr {el ; 
a]]; T --+ eval [cons [assoe {ear {el; a]; 
evlis [edr [e]; all; a]]; 
eq [caar [e]; LABEL] --~ eval [cons [eaddar {el; cdr [e]]; 
cons {list [cadar {el; car [e]; a]]; 
eq [eaar [e]; LAMBDA] -+ ewd [caddar [e]; 
append [pair [ca.dar {el; evils [cdr {el; a]; a]]] 
and 
evcon [c; a] = [eval [caar [e]; a] -~ eval [eadar [c]; al; 
T --~ evcon [cdr [c]; a]] 
and 
evils [m; a] = [uull [m] --+ NIL; 
T -~ cons [eval [car [m]; a]; evlis [cdr [m]; a]]] 
We now explain a number of points about these defini- 
tions. 
1. apply itself forms an expression representing the 
value of the function applied to the arguments, and puts 
the work of evaluating this expression onto a function eval. 
It uses appq to put quotes around each of the arguments, 
so that eval will regard them as standing for themselves. 
2. eval [e; a] has two arguments, an expression e to be 
evahmted, and a list of pairs a. The first item of each pair 
is an atomic symbol, and the second is the expression for 
which the symbol stands. 
3. If the expression to be evaluated is atomic, eval 
evaluates whatever is paired with it first on the list a. 
4. If e is not atomic but car [e] is atomic, then the expres- 
' 
~' 
(ATOM, e) or 
sion has one of the forms (QUO I'E, e) or 
(EQ, el, e2) or (COND, (pl, e,),..., (P,,, e,,)), or 
(CAR, e) or (CDR, e) or (CONS, e,, e2) or (f, e,, .." , e,,) 
where f is an atomic symbol. 
In the case (QUOTE; e) the expression e, itself, is taken. 
In the case of (ATOM, e) or (CAR, e) or (CDR, e) the 
expression e is evaluated and the appropriate function 
taken. In the case of (EQ, el, e2) or (CONS, el, e~) two 
expressions have to be evaluated. In the case of (COND, 
Communications of the ACM 
18~ 
(p~, el), -.. , (p,~, e,)) the p's havo to be evaluated in 
order until a true p is found, and theH the eorresponding o 
must be evaluated. This is accomplished by eveon. Finally, 
in the case of (f, o,, ... , on) we evaluate t, he expression 
that results from replacing f in this expression by whatever 
it; is paired with in the list a. 
5. The evaluation of ((LABEI~, f, g), e~, • - • , e,,) is 'te- 
complished by evaluating (8, o~ , • .. , e~) with the pairing 
(f, (LABEL, f, 8)) put on the front of the previous list, a 
of pairs. 
6. Finally, the evaluation of ( (LA MBDA, (x~, • - - , x,~), 
~), e~, ... , e,~) is accomplished by evaluating ~; with tho 
list of pairs ((xt, o~), ... , ((xn, o,)) put on the front of 
the previous list a. 
The list a could be eliminated, and LAMBDA and 
LABEl, exprossions evaluated by substituting the argu- 
ments for the variables in. the expressions ~;. Unfortu- 
nately, difficulties involving collisions of bound variables 
arise, but they are avoided by using the list a. 
Calculating the values of functions by using apply is an 
activity better suited to electronic computers than to 
people. As an illustration, however, we now give some of 
the steps for calculating 
apply [(LABEL, FF, (LAMBDA, (X), (COND, 
((ATOM, X), X), ((QUOTE, T), 
(FF, (Ca~, X)))))); ((A.B))] = 
The first argument is tho S-expression that represents the 
function ff defined in seetion 3d. We shall abbreviate it 
by using the lettor ¢. Wo have 
apply [~; ((A-B))] 
= evaI[((LABEL, FF, ¢), (QUOTE, (A-B))); NIL] 
where ¢ is tho part of ¢ beginning (LAMBDA 
= eval[((LAMBDA, (X), ~o), (QUOTE, (A.B))); 
((FF, ¢))] 
where ca is the part of ¢ beginning (COND 
=eval [(CONI), (rr~, et), (~r~, e=)); ((X, (QUOTE, 
(A.B))), (FF, ¢))] 
Denoting ( (X, (QUOTE, ( A- B ) ) ), (FF, ¢) ) by a, 
wo obtain 
= ovoon [( (~-~, ~), (~r~, ~.) ) ; ~*1 
This involves eval [~rt ; co] 
= eval [(ATOM, X); a] 
= atom loyal iX; a]] 
= atom loyal [assoe iX; ( (X, (QUOTE, (A. B) ) ), 
(FF, ¢))]; all 
= atom [oval [(QUOTE, (A. B)); a]] 
= atom [(A.B)] 
=F

()ur main caleulation contirmes wiih 
apply [¢5; ((A. B))] 
= ore, on [((~, ~))' ~t, 
which involves oval [~ ; a] = eva[ [(Q[YOTE, T); ~] = T. :~ 
Our main calculation again eontim~es with 
apply [¢; ((A. B) )] 
= oval [e2 ; a] 
= eval [(FF, (CAR, X)); a] 
=eval [cons [4; evils [((CAR, X)); a]]; a] 
Evaluating evlis [((C, AR, X)) ; a] involves 
'k 
oval [(c~ t{, x) ,~l - 
ear [oval [X; all] 
= ear [(A'B)I, where we took steps from the earli~,r '( 
computation of a.tom loyal IX; all = A,

list [list [QUOTt!;; A]] = ((QU)rE, A)) 
and otlr main quantity becomes 
eva| [(4,, (q~Jo IL, x)); ~] 
The subsequent steps are made as in tho begimfing ,,f

Therefore we end up with oval iX; a~] fl'om the .e~'co~,

g. Functions with Functions as Arguments. There are a 
number of useflfl functions some of whose arguments are 
functions. They are especially useful in defining othe|" rune- 
tions. One such function is maplist ix; f] with an S-expres- 
sion argument x and an argument f that, is a function from 
S-expressions to S-expressions. Wo define 
lnaplist [x; fl = [null [xl --~ NIL; 
T --+ cons [fix]; maplist [cdr ix]; i'1 ~] 
:['he usefulness of maplist is illustrated by fornmlas for 
the partial derivative with rospeet to x of expressions i~> 
volving sums and products of x and other variables. The 
S-expressions that we shall differentiate are formed ~ 
follows. 
1. An atomic symbol is an allowed expression. 
2. If e~, e~, • • • , e, are allowed expressions, (PLUS, <, 
... , en) and (TIMES, e~, ... , e.) arc also, a.nd represeld' 
the sum and product, respectively, of e~, • • - , e,. 
This is, essentially, the Polish notation for functio~* 
except, that the inclusion of paronthe~es and eoinmas tfl" 
lows functions of variablo numbers of arguments. An exa m~ 
ple of an allowed expression is (TIMES, X (t)L[~'S' 
X, A), Y), the conventional algebraic notati(m for whicD 
is X(X + A)Y.

Our different.fallen tormula, which gives the derivative 
of y with respecti (.() x, is 
diff [y; x] = [atom [y]---* [eq [y; x] -~, ON[i;; T --, ZEtIOI;

X[[w]; ~--~eq [z; w] -÷ car [w]; 1l' ~ diff' [car [[w]; xlll]]]] 
The derivative of the allowed expression, as computed 
by this formula, is 
(PLUS, (TIMES, ONE, (I'IA;rs, X, A), Y), 
(TIMES, X, (PLUS, ONE, ZERO), Y), 
(TIMES, X, (PLUS, X, A), ZERO)) 
Besides maplist, another useful function with functional 
arguments is search, which is defined as 
search Ix; p; f; u] --- [null Ix] --+ u; p[x] --~ f[x]; 
T -+ search [cdr [x]; p; f; u] 
The function ,search is used to search a list for an element 
that has the property p, and if such an element is found, f 
of that element is taken. If there is no such element, the 
function u of no argument is computed. 
4. The LISP Programming System 
The LISP programming system is a system for using 
the IBM 704 computer to compute with symbolic informa- 
tion in the form of S-expressions. It has been or will be 
used for the following purposes: 
1. Writing a compiler to compile LISP programs into 
machine language. 
2. Writing a program t.o check proofs in a (:lass of 
formal logical systems. 
3. Writing programs for fornml differentiation and 
integration. 
4. Writing programs to realize various algorithms for 
generating proofs in predicate calculus. 
5. Making certain engineering calculations whose re- 
sults are formulas rather than numbers. 
6. Programming the Advice Taker system. 
The basis of the system is a way of writing computer 
programs to evaluate S-functions. This will be described 
in the following sections. 
In addition to the facilities for describing S-functions, 
there are facilities for using S-flmctions in programs 
written as sequences of statements along the lines of 
FORTRAN (4) or AL(;OI; (5). These features will not be 
described in tiffs article.

FIG.

(c) 
a. R<'4ffe,~entalio~ of £'-P~'xpre.~,~wns b:q List Structure. A 
list structttre is a collection of computer words arranged 
as in figure la or lb. Each word of the list structure is 
represented by one of the subdivided rectangles in the 
figure. The left box of a rectangle represents the address 
field of the word and the right box represents the decre- 
ment field. An arrow from a box ~;o another rectangle 
means that the field corresponding to the box contains 
the location of the word corresponding to the other 
rectangle. 
It is permitted for a substructure to occur in more than 
one place in t~ list structm'e, as in figure lb. but it is no~ 
permitted for a sturcture to have cycles, as in figure le. 
An atomic symbol is represented in the computer by a 
list structure of special form called the association list of 
the symbol. The address field of the first word contains a 
special constant which enables the program to tell that 
this word represents an atomic symbol. We shall describe 
association lists in section 4b. 
(o) 
(b) 
l?m. 2 
An S-expression x that is not atomic is represented by 
a word, the address and decrement parts of which contain 
tile locations of the subexpressions ear[x] and edr[x], 
respectively. If we use the symbols A, B, ere, to denote 
the locations of the association list of these symbols, then 
tile S-expression ((A.B).(C.(E.F))) is represented by 
the list structure a of figure 2. Turning to the list. form of 
S-expressions, we see that, tile S-expression (A, (B, C), D), 
which is an abbreviation for (A.((B.(C-N[L)).(D- 
NIL))), is represented by tile list structure of figure 2b. 
When a list structure is regarded as representing a list, 
we see that each term of the list occupies tile address 
part of a word, the decrement part, of which points to the 
word containing the next term, while the last word has 
NIL in its decrement. 
An expression that has a given subexpression occurring 
more than once can be represented in more than one w'~y. 
Whether the list structure for the subexpression is or is not 
repeated depends upon the history of the program. 
Whether or not a subexpression is repeated will make no

difference in the results of a program as they appear out- 
side the machine, although it will affect the time and 
storage requirements. For example, tt~e S-('xpressio~ 
((A. B). (A. B)) can be represented by either the list. struc- 
ture of figure 3a or 3b.

Tile prohibition against circular list, structures is es- 
sentially a prohibition against an expression being a sub- 
expression of itself. Such an expression could not exis~ ot~ 
paper in a world with our topology. Circular l:]st structures 
would have some advantages in the machine, for example, 
for representing recursive hmctions, but difficulties in 
printing them, and in certain other operations, make it 
seem advisable not to use them for the present. 
The advantages of list structures for the storage of 
symbolic expressions are: 
1. The size and even the number of expressions with 
which the program will have to deal cannot be predicted 
in advance. Therefore, it is difficult to arrange blocks of 
storage of fixed length to contain them. 
2. Registers can be put back on the free-storage list 
when they are no longer needed. Even one register re- 
turned to the list is of value, but if expressions are stored 
linearly, it is difficult to make use of blocks of registers of 
odd sizes that may become available. 
3. An expression that occurs as a subexpression of 
several expressions need be represented in storage only 
once. 
b. Association Lists. In the LIsP programming system 
we put more in the association list of a symbol than is 
required by the mathematical system described in the 
previous sections. In fact, any information that we desire 
to associate with the symbol nmy be put on the associa- 
tion list. This information may include: the print name, 
that is, the string of letters and digits which represents 
the symbol outside the machine; a numerical value if 
the symbol represents a number; another S-expression 
if the symbol, in some way, serves as a name for it; or the 
location of a routine if the symbol represents a functior~ 
for which there is a machine-language subroutine. All this 
implies that in the machine system there are more prirni- 
tive entities than have been described in the: sections on 
the mathematical system. 
~mme of the symbol who~e asso(qaEi(m list this is hangs 
from the uext~ word <m ~h(, association list. l:n the second 
row of the figure w(, have a list of three words. The address -part of each of th~c words polaris to ~ word containing 
six (i4:)it. characters. The last, uord is filled (:)~tt with a 
6.t:)iC combination that do(,s not~ represent a character

c. Free-Storaf/c List. At. any given time only a part of 
the memory reserved for list, structures will actually be in 
use for storing S-expressions, The remaining registers (in 
ore' system the number, initially, is approxima{,ely 15,000) 
are arranged in a single list c.dled the fl'ee-.stora,qe liet. A 
cert:dn register, :Fm,:E, in the program contains the loca- 
ti(:m of the first register in this list. When a word is re- 
quired to form some additional list structure, the first 
word on the fl'ee-,s'torage list is taken and the number in 
register FaEE is changed to become the location of the 
second word on the free-storage list. No provision need be 
made for the user to program the return of registers to the 
free-st.orage list. 
This return takes place atttoInatieally, approximately 
as follows (it is necessary to give a simplified deseriptiol~ 
of this process in this report): There is a fixed set of base 
registers in the program which contains the locations of ~f 
list structures that, are accessible to the program. Of ] 
course, because list structures branch, an arbitrary num- 
ber of registers may be involved. Each register that is } 
accessible to the program is accessible because it can be 
reached from one or more of the base registers by a chain 
of car and edr operations. When the contents of a base 
register are changed, it may happen that the register Co 
which the base register formerly pointed cannot be reached 
by a car-cdr chain from any base register. Such a register 
may be considered abandoned by the program because its 
contents can no longer be found by any possible program; 
hence its contents are no longer of interest, and so we 
would like to have it back on the free-storage list. This ,' 
comes about in the following way. 
Nothing happens until the program runs out of free 
storage. WherJ a free register is wanted, and there :is none 
left on the free-storage list, a reclamation cycle starts. -- . -. 
. 
For the present, we shall only describe how print names 
are represented on association lists so that in reading or 
printing the program can establish a correspondence 
between information on punched cards, magr:Jetic tape or 
printed page and the list structure inside the machine. 
The association list. of the symbol DIFFEI{t~3NTIATt?] has a 
segment (ff the form shown in figure 4, Here lmame is a 
symbol that indicates that the struett~re for the. print

t 
First, the program finds all registers accessible from the t 
base registers and makes their signs negative. This is ! 
accomplished by starting from each of the base registers i 
(:ommunications of the ACM 
192 
and changing the sign of every register that can be reached 
from it by a car-cdr chain. If the program encounters a 
register in this process which already has a negative sign, 
it assumes that this register has already been reached. 
After all of the accessible registers have had their signs 
changed, the program goes through the area of memory 
reserved for the storage of list structures and puts all the 
registers whose signs were not changed in the previous 
step back on the free-storage list, and makes the signs of 
the accessible registers positive again. 
This process, because it is entirely automatic, is more 
convenient for the programmer than a system in which 
he has to keep track of and erase unwanted lists. Its effi- 
ciency depends upon not coming close to exhausting the 
available memory with accessible lists. This is because the 
reclamation process requires several seconds to execute, 
and therefore must result in the addition of at least 
several thousand registers to the free-storage list if the 
program is not to spend most of its time in reclamation. 
d. Elementary S-Functions in the Computer. We shall 
now describe the computer representations of atom, =, 
ear, cdr, and cons. An S-expression is communicated to 
the program that represents a function as the location of 
the word representing it, and the programs give S-expres- 
sion answers in the same form. 
atom. As stated above, a word representing an atomic 
symbol has a special constant in its address part: atom is 
programmed as an open subroutine that tests this part. 
Unless the M-expression atom[e] occurs as a condition in 
a conditional expression, the symbol T or F is generated 
as the result of the test. In ease of a conditional expression, 
a conditional transfer is used and the symbol T or F is 
not generated. 
eq. 
The program for eq[e; f] involves testing for the 
numerical equality of the locations of the words. This 
works because each atomic symbol has only one association 
list. As with atom, the result is either a conditional transfer 
or one of the symbols T or F. 
car. Computing car[x] involves getting the contents 
of the _address part of register x. This is essentially accom- 
plished by the single instruction ci~a 0, i, where the argu- 
ment is in index register i, and the result appears in the 
address part of the accumulator. (We take the view that 
the places from which a function takes its arguments and 
into which it puts its results are prescribed in the defini- 
tion of the function, and it is the responsibility of the 
programmer or the compiler to insert the required data- 
moving instructions to get the results of one calculation 
in position for the next.) ("car" is a mnemonic for "con- 
tents of the _address part of register.") 
edr. edr is handled in the same way as ear, except that 
the result appears in the decrement part of the accumu- 
lator. ("edr" stands for "cgntents of the decrement part 
of register.") 
cons. The value of cons[x; y] must be the location of a 
register that has x and y in its address and decrement 
parts, respectively. There may not be such a register in 
the computer and, even if there were, it would be time- 
consuming to find it. Actually, what we do is to take the 
first available register from the free-storage list, put x and 
y in tlhe address and decrement parts, respectively, and 
make the value of the function the location of the register 
taken. ("cons" is an abbreviation for "construct.") 
It, is the subroutine for cons that initiates the reclama- 
tion when the free-storage list is exhausted. In the version 
of the system that is used at present cons is represented 
by a closed subroutine. In the compiled version, cons is 
open. 
e. Representation of S-Functions by Programs. The 
compilation of functions that are compositions of ear, 
cdr, and cons, either by hand or by a compiler program, 
is straightforward. Conditional expressions give no trouble 
except that they must be so compiled that only the p's 
and e's that are required are computed. However, prob- 
lems arise in the compilation of reeursive functions. 
In general (we shall discuss an exception), the routine 
for a recursive function uses itself as a subroutine. For 
example, the program for subst[x;y;z] uses itself as 
a subroutine to evaluate the result into the subexpres- 
sions ear[z] and cdr[z]. While subst[x;y:edr[z]] is being 
evaluated, the result of the previous evaluation of 
subst[x; y; car[z]] must be saved in a temporary storage 
register. However, subst may need the same register for 
evaluating subst[x;y;edr[z]]. This possible conflict is re- 
solved by the SAVE and UNSAVE routines that use 
the public push-down list. The SAVE routine is entered 
at the beginning of the routine for the reeursive function 
with a request to save a given set of consecutive registers. 
A block of registers called the public push-down list is 
reserved for this purpose. The SAVE routine has an index 
that tells it how many registers in the push-down list are 
already in use. It moves the contents of the registers 
which are to be saved to the first unused registers in the 
push-down list, advances the index of the list, and returns 
to the program from which control came. This program 
may then freely use these registers for temporary storage. 
Before the routine exits it uses UNSAVE, which restores 
the contents of the temporary registers from the push- 
down list and moves back the index of this list. The result 
of these conventions is described, in programming termi- 
nology, by saying that the reeursive subroutine is trans- 
parent to the temporary storage registers. 
f. Status of the LISP Programming System (February 
1960). A variant of the function apply described in section 
5f has been translated into a program APPLY for the 
IBM 704. Since this routine can compute values of S- 
functions given their descriptions as S-expressions and 
their arguments, it serves as an interpreter for the Lisp 
programming language which describes computation 
processes in this way. 
The program APPLY has been imbedded in the Lisp 
programming system which has the following features: 
1. The programmer may define any number of S-fune- 
Communications of the ACM 
193 
tions by S-expressions. These ftmctions may refer to each 
other or to certain S-functions represet~ted by machine 
language program. 
2. The vMues of defined functions may be computed. 
3. S-expressions may be read and printed (directly or 
via magnetic tape). 
4. Some error diagnostic and selective tracing facilities 
are included. 
5. The programmer may have selected S-function,s 
compiled into machine language programs put into the 
core memory. Values of compiled functions are computed 
about 60 times as fast as they would if interpreted. Corn- 
pilaf}on is fast, enough so that it is not necessary t,o punch 
compiled program for future use. 
6. A program feature allows programs containing 
assignment and go to staternents in the style of ALl;eL. 
7. Computation with floating point numers is possible 
in the system but, this is inefficient. 
8. A programmers manuM is being prepared. 
The Lisp programming system is appropriate for corn- 
putations where the data can conveniently be represented 
as symbolic expressions allowing expressions of the same 
kind as subexpressions. A version of the system for the 
IBM 709 is being prepared. 
5. Another Formalism for Functions of Symbolic 
Expressions 
There are a number of ways of defining functions of 
symbolic expressions which are quite similar to the system 
we have adopted. Each of them involves three basic func- 
tions, conditional expressions, and recursivc function 
definitions, but the class of exprcssions corresponding to 
S-expressions is different, and so are the precise definitions 
of the functions. We shall describe one of these variams 
called linear IASP. 
The L-expressions are defined as follows: 
1. A finite list, of Characters is admitted. 
2. Any string of admitted characters'ia an L-expression. 
This includes the null st, ring denoted by A. 
There are t,hree functions of strings: 
1. firs}Ix] is the first character of the string x. 
first[A] is undefined. 
For example: 
first[ABC] = A 
2. rest[x] is the string of characters which remains when 
the first character of the string is deleted. 
rest[A] is undefined. 
For example: 
resf[ABC] = BC 
3. eombineIx; y] is the string formed by prefixing the 
character x to the string y. 
For example: 
combine[A; BC] = ABC 
There are three predicates on strings: 
1. char[x], x is a single character. 
2. null[x], x is the null string. 
3. x = y, defined for x and y characters. 
The advantage of linear L~sP is that no characters are 
given special roles, as are parentheses, dots, and commas 
ill LISP, This permits computations with all expressions 
194 
that ca*it be writ Ien li:aearly. The disadva~.iiage of m~ea~ 
LisP is that; ~he extraction of subexpressions is a faith. I ;!:

hard to write, in linear L~s>, functions that correspoad i:,.,

convenient way of progr'~mming, i:n linear L:~se, the mor~,

are to be represented by computer routines, Ltse is ess<~. 
tially faster. 
6. Flowcharts and Recurs}on 
Since both the usual form of computer program m~d re- 
cursive function definitions are universal computationally, 
i~ is interesting to display the relation between them. The 
translation of recurs}re symbolic functions inlo compuier 
programs was the subject of the rest of this report, h~ ~his 
section we show how to go the otter way, at least i~ 
prineipk. ~. 
The state of the machine at any time during a compu,a- 
lion is gNen by the values of a number of variables, l,e~ 
these variables be combined into a vector ~. Consider a 
program block with one entrance and one exit. It (teti~,es 
and is essentiMly defined by a certain function f tha~ 
takes one machine configuration into another, that is, f has 
the form ~' = f(~). Let us call f lhe associated functio,~ of 
the program block. Now let a number of such })locks i, 
combined into a program by decision elements u that (h,.

functions was noticed by N. Rochester, and he discovered 
~n alternative to the solution involving label which has 
been used here. The form of subroutine for cons which 
permits its composition with other functions was invented, 
in connection with another programming system, by C. 
Gerberiek and H. L. Gelernter, of IBM Corporation. The 
Lisp programming system was developed by a group

Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions
 and Their Computation by Machine, Part I
 John McCarthy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. ∗
 April 1960
 1 Introduction
 A programming system called LISP (for LISt Processor) has been developed
 for the IBM 704 computer by the Artificial Intelligence group at M.I.T. The
 system was designed to facilitate experiments with a proposed system called
 the Advice Taker, whereby a machine could be instructed to handle declarative
 as well as imperative sentences and could exhibit “common sense” in carrying
 out its instructions. The original proposal [1] for the Advice Taker was made
 in November 1958. The main requirement was a programming system for
 manipulating expressions representing formalized declarative and imperative
 sentences so that the Advice Taker system could make deductions.
 In the course of its development the LISP system went through several
 stages of simplification and eventually came to be based on a scheme for rep
resenting the partial recursive functions of a certain class of symbolic expres
sions. This representation is independent of the IBM 704 computer, or of any
 other electronic computer, and it now seems expedient to expound the system
 by starting with the class of expressions called S-expressions and the functions
 called S-functions.

In this article, we first describe a formalism for defining functions recur
sively. We believe this formalism has advantages both as a programming
 language and as a vehicle for developing a theory of computation. Next, we
 describe S-expressions and S-functions, give some examples, and then describe
 the universal S-function apply which plays the theoretical role of a universal
 Turing machine and the practical role of an interpreter. Then we describe the
 representation of S-expressions in the memory of the IBM 704 by list structures
 similar to those used by Newell, Shaw and Simon [2], and the representation
 of S-functions by program. Then we mention the main features of the LISP
 programming system for the IBM 704. Next comes another way of describ
ing computations with symbolic expressions, and finally we give a recursive
 function interpretation of flow charts.
 We hope to describe some of the symbolic computations for which LISP
 has been used in another paper, and also to give elsewhere some applications
 of our recursive function formalism to mathematical logic and to the problem
 of mechanical theorem proving.
 2 Functions and Function Definitions
 We shall need a number of mathematical ideas and notations concerning func
tions in general. Most of the ideas are well known, but the notion of conditional
 expression is believed to be new1, and the use of conditional expressions per
mits functions to be defined recursively in a new and convenient way.
 a. Partial Functions. A partial function is a function that is defined only
 on part of its domain. Partial functions necessarily arise when functions are
 defined by computations because for some values of the arguments the com
putation defining the value of the function may not terminate. However, some
 of our elementary functions will be defined as partial functions.
 b. Propositional Expressions and Predicates. A propositional expression is
 an expression whose possible values are T (for truth) and F (for falsity). We
 shall assume that the reader is familiar with the propositional connectives ∧
 (“and”), ∨ (“or”), and ¬ (“not”). Typical propositional expressions are:
 1
 reference Kleene
 2
x <y
 (x < y)∧(b = c)
 x is prime
 Apredicate is a function whose range consists of the truth values T and F.
 c. Conditional Expressions. The dependence of truth values on the values
 of quantities of other kinds is expressed in mathematics by predicates, and the
 dependence of truth values on other truth values by logical connectives. How
ever, the notations for expressing symbolically the dependence of quantities of
 other kinds on truth values is inadequate, so that English words and phrases
 are generally used for expressing these dependences in texts that describe other
 dependences symbolically. For example, the function |x| is usually defined in
 words. Conditional expressions are a device for expressing the dependence of
 quantities on propositional quantities. A conditional expression has the form
 (p1 → e1,···,pn → en)
 where the p’s are propositional expressions and the e’s are expressions of any
 kind. It may be read, “If p1 then e1 otherwise if p2 then e2, ··· , otherwise if
 pn then en,” or “p1 yields e1,···,pn yields en.” 2
 We now give the rules for determining whether the value of
 (p1 → e1,···,pn → en)
 is defined, and if so what its value is. Examine the p’s from left to right. If
 a p whose value is T is encountered before any p whose value is undefined is
 encountered then the value of the conditional expression is the value of the
 corresponding e (if this is defined). If any undefined p is encountered before
 2
 I sent a proposal for conditional expressions to a CACM forum on what should be
 included in Algol 60. Because the item was short, the editor demoted it to a letter to the
 editor, for which CACM subsequently apologized. The notation given here was rejected for
 Algol 60, because it had been decided that no new mathematical notation should be allowed
 in Algol 60, and everything new had to be English. The if ...then...else that Algol 60
 adopted was suggested by John Backus.
 3
a true p, or if all p’s are false, or if the e corresponding to the first true p is
 undefined, then the value of the conditional expression is undefined. We now
 give examples.
 (1 < 2 →4,1>2→3)=4
 (2 < 1 →4,2>1→3,2>1→2)=3
 (2 < 1 →4,T →3)=3
 (2 < 1 → 0
 0 ,T →3)=3
 (2 < 1 →3,T → 0
 0 ) is undefined
 (2 < 1 →3,4<1→4) is undefined
 Some of the simplest applications of conditional expressions are in giving
 such definitions as
 |x| = (x < 0 →−x,T →x)
 δij = (i = j → 1,T →0)
 sgn(x) = (x < 0 → −1,x = 0→0,T →1)
 d. Recursive Function Definitions. By using conditional expressions we
 can, without circularity, define functions by formulas in which the defined
 function occurs. For example, we write
 n! = (n =0→1,T →n·(n−1)!)
 When we use this formula to evaluate 0! we get the answer 1; because of the
 way in which the value of a conditional expression was defined, the meaningless
 4
expression 0 · (0- 1)! does not arise. The evaluation of 2! according to this
 definition proceeds as follows:
 2! = (2=0→1,T →2·(2−1)!)
 = 2·1!
 = 2·(1=0→1T →·(1−1)!)
 = 2·1·0!
 = 2·1·(0 =0→1,T →0·(0−1)!)
 = 2·1·1
 = 2
 We now give two other applications of recursive function definitions. The
 greatest common divisor, gcd(m,n), of two positive integers m and n is com
puted by means of the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is expressed by
 the recursive function definition:
 gcd(m,n) = (m > n →gcd(n,m),rem(n,m) = 0 → m,T → gcd(rem(n,m),m))
 where rem(n,m) denotes the remainder left when n is divided by m.
 The Newtonian algorithm for obtaining an approximate square root of a
 number a, starting with an initial approximation x and requiring that an
 acceptable approximation y satisfy |y2 − a| < ϵ, may be written as
 sqrt(a, x, ϵ)
 = (|x2 −a| < ϵ → x,T → sqrt (a, 1
 2
 (x+ a
 x
 ),ϵ))
 The simultaneous recursive definition of several functions is also possible,
 and we shall use such definitions if they are required.
 There is no guarantee that the computation determined by a recursive
 definition will ever terminate and, for example, an attempt to compute n!
 from our definition will only succeed if n is a non-negative integer. If the
 computation does not terminate, the function must be regarded as undefined
 for the given arguments.
 The propositional connectives themselves can be defined by conditional
 expressions. We write
 5
p ∧q = (p→q,T →F)
 p ∨q = (p→T,T →q)
 ¬p = (p→F,T →T)
 p ⊃q = (p→q,T →T)
 It is readily seen that the right-hand sides of the equations have the correct
 truth tables. If we consider situations in which p or q may be undefined, the
 connectives ∧ and ∨ are seen to be noncommutative. For example if p is false
 and q is undefined, we see that according to the definitions given above p ∧ q
 is false, but q ∧ p is undefined. For our applications this noncommutativity is
 desirable, since p∧q is computed by first computing p, and if p is false q is not
 computed. If the computation for p does not terminate, we never get around
 to computing q. We shall use propositional connectives in this sense hereafter.
 e. Functions and Forms. It is usual in mathematics—outside of mathe
matical logic—to use the word “function” imprecisely and to apply it to forms
 such as y2+x. Because we shall later compute with expressions for functions,
 we need a distinction between functions and forms and a notation for express
ing this distinction. This distinction and a notation for describing it, from
 which we deviate trivially, is given by Church [3].
 Let f be an expression that stands for a function of two integer variables.
 It should make sense to write f(3,4) and the value of this expression should be
 determined. The expression y2+x does not meet this requirement; y2+x(3,4)
 is not a conventional notation, and if we attempted to define it we would be
 uncertain whether its value would turn out to be 13 or 19. Church calls an
 expression like y2 + x, a form. A form can be converted into a function if we
 can determine the correspondence between the variables occurring in the form
 and the ordered list of arguments of the desired function. This is accomplished
 by Church’s λ-notation.
 If E is a form in variables x1,···,xn, then λ((x1,···,xn),E) will be taken
 to be the function of n variables whose value is determined by substituting
 the arguments for the variables x1,···,xn in that order in E and evaluating
 the resulting expression. For example, λ((x,y),y2 + x) is a function of two
 variables, and λ((x,y),y2 + x)(3,4) = 19.
 The variables occurring in the list of variables of a λ-expression are dummy
 or bound, like variables of integration in a definite integral. That is, we may
 6
change the names of the bound variables in a function expression without
 changing the value of the expression, provided that we make the same change
 for each occurrence of the variable and do not make two variables the same
 that previously were different. Thus λ((x,y),y2 + x),λ((u,v),v2 + u) and
 λ((y,x),x2 + y) denote the same function.
 We shall frequently use expressions in which some of the variables are
 bound by λ’s and others are not. Such an expression may be regarded as
 defining a function with parameters. The unbound variables are called free
 variables.
 An adequate notation that distinguishes functions from forms allows an
 unambiguous treatment of functions of functions. It would involve too much
 of a digression to give examples here, but we shall use functions with functions
 as arguments later in this report.
 Difficulties arise in combining functions described by λ-expressions, or by
 any other notation involving variables, because different bound variables may
 be represented by the same symbol. This is called collision of bound variables.
 There is a notation involving operators that are called combinators for com
bining functions without the use of variables. Unfortunately, the combinatory
 expressions for interesting combinations of functions tend to be lengthy and
 unreadable.
 f. Expressions for Recursive Functions. The λ-notation is inadequate for
 naming functions defined recursively. For example, using λ’s, we can convert
 the definition
 sqrt(a, x,ϵ) = (|x2 − a| < ϵ → x,T → sqrt(a, 1
 2 (x+ a
 x ),ϵ))
 into
 sqrt = λ((a,x,ϵ),(|x2 − a| < ϵ → x,T → sqrt(a, 1
 2 (x+ a
 x ),ϵ))),
 but the right-hand side cannot serve as an expression for the function be
cause there would be nothing to indicate that the reference to sqrt within the
 expression stood for the expression as a whole.
 In order to be able to write expressions for recursive functions, we intro
duce another notation. label(a,E) denotes the expression E, provided that
 occurrences of a within E are to be interpreted as referring to the expression
 7
as a whole. Thus we can write
 label(sqrt, λ((a,x,ϵ),(|x2 − a| < ϵ → x,T → sqrt(a, 1
 2
 (x + a
 x
 ),ϵ))))
 as a name for our sqrt function.
 The symbol a in label (a,E) is also bound, that is, it may be altered
 systematically without changing the meaning of the expression. It behaves
 differently from a variable bound by a λ, however.
 3 RecursiveFunctionsof Symbolic Expressions
 We shall first define a class of symbolic expressions in terms of ordered pairs
 and lists. Then we shall define five elementary functions and predicates, and
 build from them by composition, conditional expressions, and recursive def
initions an extensive class of functions of which we shall give a number of
 examples. We shall then show how these functions themselves can be ex
pressed as symbolic expressions, and we shall define a universal function apply
 that allows us to compute from the expression for a given function its value
 for given arguments. Finally, we shall define some functions with functions as
 arguments and give some useful examples.
 a. A Class of Symbolic Expressions. We shall now define the S-expressions
 (S stands for symbolic). They are formed by using the special characters
 ·
 )
 (
 and an infinite set of distinguishable atomic symbols. For atomic symbols,
 we shall use strings of capital Latin letters and digits with single imbedded
 8
blanks.3 Examples of atomic symbols are
 A
 ABA
 APPLE PIE NUMBER 3
 There is a twofold reason for departing from the usual mathematical prac
tice of using single letters for atomic symbols. First, computer programs fre
quently require hundreds of distinguishable symbols that must be formed from
 the 47 characters that are printable by the IBM 704 computer. Second, it is
 convenient to allow English words and phrases to stand for atomic entities for
 mnemonic reasons. The symbols are atomic in the sense that any substructure
 they may have as sequences of characters is ignored. We assume only that dif
ferent symbols can be distinguished. S-expressions are then defined as follows:
 1. Atomic symbols are S-expressions.
 2. If e1 and e2 are S-expressions, so is (e1 · e2).
 Examples of S-expressions are
 AB
 (A· B)
 ((AB · C)·D)
 An S-expression is then simply an ordered pair, the terms of which may be
 atomic symbols or simpler S-expressions. We can can represent a list of arbi
trary length in terms of S-expressions as follows. The list
 (m1,m2,···,mn)
 is represented by the S-expression
 (m1 · (m2 ·(···(mn · NIL)···)))
 Here NIL is an atomic symbol used to terminate lists. Since many of the
 symbolic expressions with which we deal are conveniently expressed as lists,
 we shall introduce a list notation to abbreviate certain S-expressions. We have
 31995 remark: Imbedded blanks could be allowed within symbols, because lists were then
 written with commas between elements.
 9
l. (m) stands for (m ·NIL).
 2. (m1,···,mn) stands for (m1 · (···(mn · NIL)···)).
 3. (m1,···,mn · x) stands for (m1 · (···(mn · x)···)).
 Subexpressions can be similarly abbreviated. Some examples of these ab
breviations are
 ((AB,C),D) for ((AB ·(C ·NIL))·(D ·NIL))
 ((A,B),C,D ·E) for ((A·(B ·NIL))·(C ·(D ·E)))
 Since we regard the expressions with commas as abbreviations for those
 not involving commas, we shall refer to them all as S-expressions.
 b. Functions of S-expressions and the Expressions That Represent Them.
 Wenow define a class of functions of S-expressions. The expressions represent
ing these functions are written in a conventional functional notation. However,
 in order to clearly distinguish the expressions representing functions from S
expressions, we shall use sequences of lower-case letters for function names
 and variables ranging over the set of S-expressions. We also use brackets and
 semicolons, instead of parentheses and commas, for denoting the application
 of functions to their arguments. Thus we write
 car[x]
 car[cons[(A · B);x]]
 In these M-expressions (meta-expressions) any S-expression that occur stand
 for themselves.
 c. The Elementary S-functions and Predicates. We introduce the following
 functions and predicates:
 1. atom. atom[x] has the value of T or F according to whether x is an
 atomic symbol. Thus
 atom [X] = T
 atom [(X · A)] = F
 2. eq. eq [x;y] is defined if and only if both x and y are atomic. eq [x; y]
 = Tif x and y are the same symbol, and eq [x; y] = F otherwise. Thus
 10
eq [X; X] = T
 eq [X; A] = F
 eq [X; (X · A)] is undefined.
 3. car. car[x] is defined if and only if x is not atomic. car [(e1 · e2)] = e1.
 Thus car [X] is undefined.
 car [(X · A)] = X
 car [((X · A) · Y )] = (X ·A)
 4. cdr. cdr [x] is also defined when x is not atomic. We have cdr
 [(e1 · e2)] = e2. Thus cdr [X] is undefined.
 cdr [(X · A)] = A cdr [((X ·A)·Y)] = Y
 5. cons. cons [x; y] is defined for any x and y. We have cons [e1;e2] =
 (e1 · e2). Thus
 cons [X; A] = (X A)
 cons [(X · A);Y] = ((X ·A)Y)
 car, cdr, and cons are easily seen to satisfy the relations
 car [cons [x; y]] = x
 cdr [cons [x; y]] = y
 cons [car [x]; cdr [x]] = x, provided that x is not atomic.
 The names “car” and “cons” will come to have mnemonic significance only
 when we discuss the representation of the system in the computer. Composi
tions of car and cdr give the subexpressions of a given expression in a given
 position. Compositions of cons form expressions of a given structure out of
 parts. The class of functions which can be formed in this way is quite limited
 and not very interesting.
 d. Recursive S-functions. We get a much larger class of functions (in fact,
 all computable functions) when we allow ourselves to form new functions of
 S-expressions by conditional expressions and recursive definition. We now give
 11
some examples of functions that are definable in this way.
 1. ff[x]. The value of ff[x] is the first atomic symbol of the S-expression x
 with the parentheses ignored. Thus
 f
 f[((A · B) · C)] = A
 We have
 f
 f[x] = [atom[x] → x;T → ff[car[x]]]
 We now trace in detail the steps in the evaluation of
 f
 f [((A · B) · C)]:
 f
 f [((A · B) · C)]
 = [atom[((A·B)·C)] → ((A·B)·C);T → ff[car[((A·B)C·)]]]
 = [F →((A·B)·C);T →ff[car[((A·B)·C)]]]
 = [T →ff[car[((A·B)·C)]]]
 = ff[car[((A·B)·C)]]
 = ff[(A·B)]
 = [atom[(A·B)] → (A·B);T → ff[car[(A·B)]]]
 = [F →(A·B);T →ff[car[(A·B)]]]
 = [T →ff[car[(A·B)]]]
 = ff[car[(A·B)]]
 = ff[A]
 12
= [atom[A] → A;T →ff[car[A]]]
 = [T →A;T →ff[car[A]]]
 = A
 2. subst [x;y;z]. This function gives the result of substituting the S
expression x for all occurrences of the atomic symbol y in the S-expression z.
 It is defined by
 subst [x; y; z] = [atom [z] → [eq [z; y] → x; T → z];
 T →cons [subst [x; y; car [z]]; subst [x; y; cdr [z]]]]
 As an example, we have
 subst[(X · A);B;((A · B) · C)] = ((A· (X ·A))·C)
 3. equal [x; y]. This is a predicate that has the value T if x and y are the
 same S-expression, and has the value F otherwise. We have
 equal [x; y] = [atom [x] ∧ atom [y] ∧ eq [x; y]]
 ∨[¬ atom [x] ∧¬ atom [y] ∧ equal [car [x]; car [y]]
 ∧ equal [cdr [x]; cdr [y]]]
 It is convenient to see how the elementary functions look in the abbreviated
 list notation. The reader will easily verify that
 (i) car[(m1,m2,···,mn)] = m1
 (ii) cdr[(ms,m2,···,mn)] = (m2,···,mn)
 (iii) cdr[(m)] = NIL
 (iv) cons[m1;(m2,···,mn)] = (m1,m2,···,mn)
 (v) cons[m;NIL] = (m)
 We define
 13
null[x] = atom[x] ∧ eq[x;NIL]
 This predicate is useful in dealing with lists.
 Compositions of car and cdr arise so frequently that many expressions can
 be written more concisely if we abbreviate
 cadr[x] for car[cdr[x]],
 caddr[x] for car[cdr[cdr[x]]], etc.
 Another useful abbreviation is to write list [e1;e2;···;en]
 for cons[e1;cons[e2;···;cons[en;NIL]···]].
 This function gives the list, (e1,···,en), as a function of its elements.
 The following functions are useful when S-expressions are regarded as lists.
 1. append [x;y].
 append [x; y] = [null[x] → y; T → cons [car [x]; append [cdr [x]; y]]]
 An example is
 append [(A, B); (C, D, E)] = (A, B, C, D, E)
 2. among [x;y]. This predicate is true if the S-expression x occurs among
 the elements of the list y. We have
 among[x;y] = ¬null[y] ∧ [equal[x;car[y]] ∨ among[x;cdr[y]]]
 3. pair [x;y]. This function gives the list of pairs of corresponding elements
 of the lists x and y. We have
 pair[x; y] = [null[x]∧null[y] → NIL;¬atom[x]∧¬atom[y] → cons[list[car[x];car[y]];pair[cdr[x];cdr[y]]]
 An example is
 pair[(A,B,C);(X,(Y,Z),U)] = ((A,X),(B,(Y,Z)),(C,U)).
 14
4. assoc [x;y]. If y is a list of the form ((u1,v1),···,(un,vn)) and x is one
 of the u’s, then assoc [x;y] is the corresponding v. We have
 assoc[x;y] = eq[caar[y];x] → cadar[y];T → assoc[x;cdr[y]]]
 An example is
 assoc[X;((W,(A,B)),(X,(C,D)),(Y,(E,F)))] = (C,D).
 5. sublis[x;y]. Here x is assumed to have the form of a list of pairs
 ((u1, v1), · · ·, (un,vn)), where the u’s are atomic, and y may be any S-expression.
 The value of sublis[x;y] is the result of substituting each v for the correspond
ing u in y. In order to define sublis, we first define an auxiliary function. We
 have
 sub2[x;z] = [null[x] → z;eq[caar[x];z] → cadar[x];T → sub2[cdr[x];z]]
 and
 sublis[x; y] = [atom[y] → sub2[x;y];T → cons[sublis[x;car[y]];sublis[x;cdr[y]]]
 We have
 sublis [((X, (A, B)), (Y, (B, C))); (A, X · Y)] = (A, (A, B), B, C)
 e. Representation of S-Functions by S-Expressions. S-functions have been
 described by M-expressions. We now give a rule for translating M-expressions
 into S-expressions, in order to be able to use S-functions for making certain
 computations with S-functions and for answering certain questions about S
functions.
 The translation is determined by the following rules in rich we denote the
 translation of an M-expression E by E*.
 1. If E is an S-expression E* is (QUOTE, E).
 2. Variables and function names that were represented by strings of lower
case letters are translated to the corresponding strings of the corresponding
 uppercase letters. Thus car* is CAR, and subst* is SUBST.
 3. A form f[e1;···;en] is translated to (f∗,e∗
 1 ···,e∗
 n). Thus cons [car [x];
 cdr [x]]∗ is (CONS, (CAR, X), (CDR, X)).
 4. {[p1 → e1;···;pn → en]}∗ is (COND, (p∗
 1,e∗
 1),···,(p∗
 n · e∗
 n)).
 15
5. {λ[[x1;···;xn];E]}∗ is (LAMBDA, (x∗
 1,···,x∗
 n),E∗).
 6. {label[a;E]}∗ is (LABEL, a∗, E∗).
 With these conventions the substitution function whose M-expression is
 label [subst; λ [[x; y; z]; [atom [z] → [eq [y; z] → x; T → z]; T → cons [subst
 [x; y; car [z]]; subst [x; y; cdr [z]]]]]] has the S-expression
 (LABEL, SUBST, (LAMBDA, (X, Y, Z), (COND ((ATOM, Z), (COND,
 (EQ, Y, Z), X), ((QUOTE, T), Z))), ((QUOTE, T), (CONS, (SUBST, X, Y,
 (CAR Z)), (SUBST, X, Y, (CDR, Z)))))))
 This notation is writable and somewhat readable. It can be made easier
 to read and write at the cost of making its structure less regular. If more
 characters were available on the computer, it could be improved considerably.4
 f. The Universal S-Function apply. There is an S-function apply with the
 property that if f is an S-expression for an S-function f′ and args is a list of
 arguments of the form (arg1,···,argn), where arg1,···,argn are arbitrary S
expressions, then apply[f;args] and f′[arg1;···;argn] are defined for the same
 values of arg1,···,argn, and are equal when defined. For example,
 λ[[x; y]; cons[car[x]; y]][(A, B);(C,D)]
 =apply[(LAMBDA,(X,Y),(CONS,(CAR,X),Y));((A,B),(C,D))] = (A,C,D)
 The S-function apply is defined by
 apply[f;args] = eval[cons[f;appq[args]];NIL],
 where
 appq[m] = [null[m] → NIL;T → cons[list[QUOTE;car[m]];appq[cdr[m]]]]
 and
 eval[e; a] = [
 41995: More characters were made available on SAIL and later on the Lisp machines.
 Alas, the world went back to inferior character sets again—though not as far back as when
 this paper was written in early 1959.
 16
atom [e] → assoc [e; a];
 atom [car [e]] → [
 eq [car [e]; QUOTE] → cadr [e];
 eq [car [e]; ATOM] → atom [eval [cadr [e]; a]];
 eq [car [e]; EQ] → [eval [cadr [e]; a] = eval [caddr [e]; a]];
 eq [car [e]; COND] → evcon [cdr [e]; a];
 eq [car [e]; CAR] → car [eval [cadr [e]; a]];
 eq [car [e]; CDR] → cdr [eval [cadr [e]; a]];
 eq [car [e]; CONS] → cons [eval [cadr [e]; a]; eval [caddr [e];
 a]]; T → eval [cons [assoc [car [e]; a];
 evlis [cdr [e]; a]]; a]];
 eq [caar [e]; LABEL] → eval [cons [caddar [e]; cdr [e]];
 cons [list [cadar [e]; car [e]; a]];
 eq [caar [e]; LAMBDA] → eval [caddar [e];
 append [pair [cadar [e]; evlis [cdr [e]; a]; a]]]
 and
 and
 evcon[c;a] = [eval[caar[c];a] → eval[cadar[c];a];T → evcon[cdr[c];a]]
 evlis[m;a] = [null[m] → NIL;T → cons[eval[car[m];a];evlis[cdr[m];a]]]
 17
We now explain a number of points about these definitions. 5
 1. apply itself forms an expression representing the value of the function
 applied to the arguments, and puts the work of evaluating this expression onto
 a function eval. It uses appq to put quotes around each of the arguments, so
 that eval will regard them as standing for themselves.
 2. eval[e;a] has two arguments, an expression e to be evaluated, and a list
 of pairs a. The first item of each pair is an atomic symbol, and the second is
 the expression for which the symbol stands.
 3. If the expression to be evaluated is atomic, eval evaluates whatever is
 paired with it first on the list a.
 4. If e is not atomic but car[e] is atomic, then the expression has one of the
 forms (QUOTE,e)or(ATOM,e)or(EQ,e1,e2)or(COND,(p1,e1),···,(pn,en)),
 or (CAR,e) or (CDR,e) or (CONS,e1,e2) or (f,e1,···,en) where f is an
 atomic symbol.
 In the case (QUOTE,e) the expression e, itself, is taken. In the case of
 (ATOM,e) or (CAR,e) or (CDR,e) the expression e is evaluated and the
 appropriate function taken. In the case of (EQ,e1,e2) or (CONS,e1,e2) two
 expressions have to be evaluated. In the case of (COND,(p1,e1),···(pn,en))
 the p’s have to be evaluated in order until a true p is found, and then the
 corresponding e must be evaluated. This is accomplished by evcon. Finally, in
 the case of (f,e1,···,en) we evaluate the expression that results from replacing
 f in this expression by whatever it is paired with in the list a.
 5. The evaluation of ((LABEL,f,E),e1,···,en) is accomplished by eval
uating (E,e1,···,en) with the pairing (f,(LABEL,f,E)) put on the front of
 the previous list a of pairs.
 6. Finally, the evaluation of ((LAMBDA,(x1,···,xn),E),e1,···en) is ac
complished by evaluating E with the list of pairs ((x1,e1),···,((xn,en)) put
 on the front of the previous list a.
 The list a could be eliminated, and LAMBDA and LABEL expressions
 evaluated by substituting the arguments for the variables in the expressions
 E. Unfortunately, difficulties involving collisions of bound variables arise, but
 they are avoided by using the list a.
 51995: This version isn’t quite right. A comparison of this and other versions of eval
 including what was actually implemented (and debugged) is given in “The Influence of the
 Designer on the Design” by Herbert Stoyan and included in Artificial Intelligence and Math
ematical Theory of Computation: Papers in Honor of John McCarthy, Vladimir Lifschitz
 (ed.), Academic Press, 1991
 18
Calculating the values of functions by using apply is an activity better
 suited to electronic computers than to people. As an illustration, however, we
 now give some of the steps for calculating
 apply [(LABEL, FF, (LAMBDA, (X), (COND, (ATOM, X), X), ((QUOTE,
 T),(FF, (CAR, X))))));((A· B))] = A
 The first argument is the S-expression that represents the function ff defined
 in section 3d. We shall abbreviate it by using the letter φ. We have
 apply [φ; ( (A·B) )]
 = eval [((LABEL, FF, ψ), (QUOTE, (A·B))); NIL]
 where ψ is the part of φ beginning (LAMBDA
 = eval[((LAMBDA, (X), ω), (QUOTE, (A·B)));((FF, φ))]
 where ω is the part of ψ beginning (COND
 = eval [(COND, (π1,ϵ1),(π2,ϵ2)); ((X, (QUOTE, (A·B) ) ), (FF, φ) )]
 Denoting ((X, (QUOTE, (A·B))), (FF, φ)) by a, we obtain
 = evcon [((π1,ϵ1), (π2,ϵ2)); a]
 This involves eval [π1;a]
 = eval [( ATOM, X); a]
 = atom [eval [X; a]]
 = atom [eval [assoc [X; ((X, (QUOTE, (A·B))), (FF,φ))];a]]
 = atom [eval [(QUOTE, (A·B)); a]]
 = atom [(A·B)],
 = F
 Our main calulation continues with
 19
apply [φ; ((A·B))]
 = evcon [((π2,ϵ2,));a],
 which involves eval [π2;a] = eval [(QUOTE, T); a] = T
 Our main calculation again continues with
 apply [φ; ((A·B))]
 = eval [ϵ2;a]
 = eval [(FF, (CAR, X));a]
 = eval [Cons [φ; evlis [((CAR, X)); a]]; a]
 Evaluating evlis [((CAR, X)); a] involves
 eval [(CAR, X); a]
 = car [eval [X; a]]
 = car [(A·B)], where we took steps from the earlier computation of atom [eval [X; a]] = A,
 and so evlis [((CAR, X)); a] then becomes
 list [list [QUOTE; A]] = ((QUOTE, A)),
 and our main quantity becomes
 = eval [(φ, (QUOTE, A)); a]
 The subsequent steps are made as in the beginning of the calculation. The
 LABEL and LAMBDA cause new pairs to be added to a, which gives a new
 list of pairs a1. The π1 term of the conditional eval [(ATOM, X); a1] has the
 20
value T because X is paired with (QUOTE, A) first in a1, rather than with
 (QUOTE, (A·B)) as in a.
 Therefore we end up with eval [X; a1] from the evcon, and this is just A.
 g. Functions with Functions as Arguments. There are a number of useful
 functions some of whose arguments are functions. They are especially useful
 in defining other functions. One such function is maplist[x;f] with an S
expression argument x and an argument f that is a function from S-expressions
 to S-expressions. We define
 maplist[x;f] = [null[x] → NIL;T → cons[f[x];maplist[cdr[x];f]]]
 The usefulness of maplist is illustrated by formulas for the partial derivative
 with respect to x of expressions involving sums and products of x and other
 variables. The S-expressions that we shall differentiate are formed as follows.
 1. An atomic symbol is an allowed expression.
 2. If e1,e2,···,en are allowed expressions, ( PLUS, e1,···,en) and (TIMES,
 e1, · · ·, en) are also, and represent the sum and product, respectively, of e1,···,en.
 This is, essentially, the Polish notation for functions, except that the in
clusion of parentheses and commas allows functions of variable numbers of
 arguments. An example of an allowed expression is (TIMES, X, (PLUS, X,
 A), Y), the conventional algebraic notation for which is X(X + A)Y.
 Our differentiation formula, which gives the derivative of y with respect to
 x, is
 diff [y; x] = [atom [y] → [eq [y; x] → ONE; T → ZERO]; eq [car [Y]; PLUS]
 →cons [PLUS; maplist [cdr [y]; λ[[z]; diff [car [z]; x]]]]; eq[car [y]; TIMES] →
 cons[PLUS; maplist[cdr[y]; λ[[z]; cons [TIMES; maplist[cdr [y]; λ[[w]; ¬ eq [z;
 w] → car [w]; T → diff [car [[w]; x]]]]]]]
 The derivative of the expression (TIMES, X, (PLUS, X, A), Y), as com
puted by this formula, is
 (PLUS, (TIMES, ONE, (PLUS, X, A), Y), (TIMES, X, (PLUS, ONE,
 ZERO), Y), (TIMES, X, (PLUS, X, A), ZERO))
 Besides maplist, another useful function with functional arguments is search,
 which is defined as
 search[x;p;f;u] = [null[x] → u;p[x] → f[x];T → search[cdr[x];p;f;u]
 21
The function search is used to search a list for an element that has the property
 p, and if such an element is found, f of that element is taken. If there is no
 such element, the function u of no arguments is computed.
 4 The LISP Programming System
 The LISP programming system is a system for using the IBM 704 computer to
 compute with symbolic information in the form of S-expressions. It has been
 or will be used for the following purposes:
 l. Writing a compiler to compile LISP programs into machine language.
 2. Writing a program to check proofs in a class of formal logical systems.
 3. Writing programs for formal differentiation and integration.
 4. Writing programs to realize various algorithms for generating proofs in
 predicate calculus.
 5. Making certain engineering calculations whose results are formulas
 rather than numbers.
 6. Programming the Advice Taker system.
 The basis of the system is a way of writing computer programs to evaluate
 S-functions. This will be described in the following sections.
 In addition to the facilities for describing S-functions, there are facilities
 for using S-functions in programs written as sequences of statements along the
 lines of FORTRAN (4) or ALGOL (5). These features will not be described
 in this article.
 a. Representation of S-Expressions by List Structure. A list structure is a
 collection of computer words arranged as in figure 1a or 1b. Each word of the
 list structure is represented by one of the subdivided rectangles in the figure.
 The left box of a rectangle represents the address field of the word and the
 right box represents the decrement field. An arrow from a box to another
 rectangle means that the field corresponding to the box contains the location
 of the word corresponding to the other rectangle.
 22
An S-expression x that is not atomic is represented by a word, the address
 and decrement parts of which contain the locations of the subexpressions car[x]
 and cdr[x], respectively. If we use the symbols A, B, etc. to denote the
 locations of the association list of these symbols, then the S-expression ((A ·
 B) · (C · (E · F))) is represented by the list structure a of figure 2. Turning
 to the list form of S-expressions, we see that the S-expression (A,(B,C),D),
 which is an abbreviation for (A·((B ·(C ·NIL))·(D ·NIL))), is represented
 by the list structure of figure 2b.
 23
 It is permitted for a substructure to occur in more than one place in a list
 structure, as in figure 1b, but it is not permitted for a structure to have cycles,
 as in figure 1c. An atomic symbol is represented in the computer by a list
 structure of special form called the association list of the symbol. The address
 f
 ield of the first word contains a special constant which enables the program to
 tell that this word represents an atomic symbol. We shall describe association
 lists in section 4b.--

 When a list structure is regarded as representing a list, we see that each term
 of the list occupies the address part of a word, the decrement part of which
 points to the word containing the next term, while the last word has NIL in
 its decrement.
 An expression that has a given subexpression occurring more than once
 can be represented in more than one way. Whether the list structure for
 the subexpression is or is not repeated depends upon the history of the pro
gram. Whether or not a subexpression is repeated will make no difference
 in the results of a program as they appear outside the machine, although it
 will affect the time and storage requirements. For example, the S-expression
 ((A·B)·(A·B)) can be represented by either the list structure of figure 3a or
 3b.----

 Figure 3
 The prohibition against circular list structures is essentially a prohibition
 24
against an expression being a subexpression of itself. Such an expression could
 not exist on paper in a world with our topology. Circular list structures would
 have some advantages in the machine, for example, for representing recursive
 functions, but difficulties in printing them, and in certain other operations,
 make it seem advisable not to use them for the present.
 The advantages of list structures for the storage of symbolic expressions
 are:
 1. The size and even the number of expressions with which the program
 will have to deal cannot be predicted in advance. Therefore, it is difficult to
 arrange blocks of storage of fixed length to contain them.
 2. Registers can be put back on the free-storage list when they are no longer
 needed. Even one register returned to the list is of value, but if expressions
 are stored linearly, it is difficult to make use of blocks of registers of odd sizes
 that may become available.
 3. An expression that occurs as a subexpression of several expressions need
 be represented in storage only once.
 b. Association Lists6 . In the LISP programming system we put more in
 the association list of a symbol than is required by the mathematical system
 described in the previous sections. In fact, any information that we desire to
 associate with the symbol may be put on the association list. This information
 may include: the print name, that is, the string of letters and digits which
 represents the symbol outside the machine; a numerical value if the symbol
 represents a number; another S-expression if the symbol, in some way, serves
 as a name for it; or the location of a routine if the symbol represents a function
 for which there is a machine-language subroutine. All this implies that in the
 machine system there are more primitive entities than have been described in
 the sections on the mathematical system.
 For the present, we shall only describe how print names are represented
 on association lists so that in reading or printing the program can establish
 a correspondence between information on punched cards, magnetic tape or
 printed page and the list structure inside the machine. The association list of
 the symbol DIFFERENTIATE has a segment of the form shown in figure 4.
 Here pname is a symbol that indicates that the structure for the print name
 of the symbol whose association list this is hanging from the next word on
 the association list. In the second row of the figure we have a list of three
 words. The address part of each of these words points to a Word containing
 61995: These were later called property lists.
 25
six 6-bit characters. The last word is filled out with a 6-bit combination that
 does not represent a character printable by the computer. (Recall that the
 IBM 7O4 has a 36-bit word and that printable characters are each represented
 by 6 bits.) The presence of the words with character information means that
 the association lists do not themselves represent S-expressions, and that only
 some of the functions for dealing with S-expressions make sense within an
 association list.

 c. Free-Storage List. At any given time only a part of the memory reserved
 for list structures will actually be in use for storing S-expressions. The remain
ing registers (in our system the number, initially, is approximately 15,000) are
 arranged in a single list called the free-storage list. A certain register, FREE,
 in the program contains the location of the first register in this list. When
 a word is required to form some additional list structure, the first word on
 the free-storage list is taken and the number in register FREE is changed to
 become the location of the second word on the free-storage list. No provision
 need be made for the user to program the return of registers to the free-storage
 list.
 This return takes place automatically, approximately as follows (it is nec
essary to give a simplified description of this process in this report): There is
 a fixed set of base registers in the program which contains the locations of list
 structures that are accessible to the program. Of course, because list struc
tures branch, an arbitrary number of registers may be involved. Each register
 that is accessible to the program is accessible because it can be reached from
 one or more of the base registers by a chain of car and cdr operations. When
 26
the contents of a base register are changed, it may happen that the register
 to which the base register formerly pointed cannot be reached by a car − cdr
 chain from any base register. Such a register may be considered abandoned
 by the program because its contents can no longer be found by any possible
 program; hence its contents are no longer of interest, and so we would like to
 have it back on the free-storage list. This comes about in the following way.
 Nothing happens until the program runs out of free storage. When a free
 register is wanted, and there is none left on the free-storage list, a reclamation7
 cycle starts.
 First, the program finds all registers accessible from the base registers and
 makes their signs negative. This is accomplished by starting from each of the
 base registers and changing the sign of every register that can be reached from
 it by a car − cdr chain. If the program encounters a register in this process
 which already has a negative sign, it assumes that this register has already
 been reached.
 After all of the accessible registers have had their signs changed, the pro
gramgoes through the area of memory reserved for the storage of list structures
 and puts all the registers whose signs were not changed in the previous step
 back on the free-storage list, and makes the signs of the accessible registers
 positive again.
 This process, because it is entirely automatic, is more convenient for the
 programmer than a system in which he has to keep track of and erase un
wanted lists. Its efficiency depends upon not coming close to exhausting the
 available memory with accessible lists. This is because the reclamation process
 requires several seconds to execute, and therefore must result in the addition
 of at least several thousand registers to the free-storage list if the program is
 not to spend most of its time in reclamation.
 d. Elementary S-Functions in the Computer. We shall now describe the
 computer representations of atom, = , car, cdr, and cons. An S-expression
 is communicated to the program that represents a function as the location of
 the word representing it, and the programs give S-expression answers in the
 same form.
 atom. As stated above, a word representing an atomic symbol has a special
 7We already called this process “garbage collection”, but I guess I chickened out of using
 it in the paper—or else the Research Laboratory of Electronics grammar ladies wouldn’t let
 me.
 27
constant in its address part: atom is programmed as an open subroutine that
 tests this part. Unless the M-expression atom[e] occurs as a condition in a
 conditional expression, the symbol T or F is generated as the result of the
 test. In case of a conditional expression, a conditional transfer is used and the
 symbol T or F is not generated.
 eq. The program for eq[e;f] involves testing for the numerical equality of
 the locations of the words. This works because each atomic symbol has only
 one association list. As with atom, the result is either a conditional transfer
 or one of the symbols T or F.
 car. Computing car[x] involves getting the contents of the address part of
 register x. This is essentially accomplished by the single instruction CLA 0, i,
 where the argument is in index register, and the result appears in the address
 part of the accumulator. (We take the view that the places from which a
 function takes its arguments and into which it puts its results are prescribed
 in the definition of the function, and it is the responsibility of the programmer
 or the compiler to insert the required datamoving instructions to get the results
 of one calculation in position for the next.) (“car” is a mnemonic for “contents
 of the address part of register.”)
 cdr. cdr is handled in the same way as car, except that the result appears
 in the decrement part of the accumulator (“cdr” stands for “contents of the
 decrement part of register.”)
 cons. The value of cons[x;y] must be the location of a register that has x
 and y in its address and decrement parts, respectively. There may not be such
 a register in the computer and, even if there were, it would be time-consuming
 to find it. Actually, what we do is to take the first available register from the
 free-storage list, put x and y in the address and decrement parts, respectively,
 and make the value of the function the location of the register taken. (“cons”
 is an abbreviation for “construct.”)
 It is the subroutine for cons that initiates the reclamation when the free
storage list is exhausted. In the version of the system that is used at present
 cons is represented by a closed subroutine. In the compiled version, cons is
 open.
 e. Representation of S-Functions by Programs. The compilation of func
tions that are compositions of car, cdr, and cons, either by hand or by a
 compiler program, is straightforward. Conditional expressions give no trouble
 except that they must be so compiled that only the p’s and e’s that are re
28
quired are computed. However, problems arise in the compilation of recursive
 functions.
 In general (we shall discuss an exception), the routine for a recursive func
tion uses itself as a subroutine. For example, the program for subst[x;y;z] uses
 itself as a subroutine to evaluate the result of substituting into the subexpres
sions car[z] and cdr[z]. While subst[x;y;cdr[z]] is being evaluated, the result
 of the previous evaluation of subst[x;y;car[z]] must be saved in a temporary
 storage register. However, subst may need the same register for evaluating
 subst[x; y;cdr[z]]. This possible conflict is resolved by the SAVE and UN
SAVE routines that use the public push-down list 8. The SAVE routine is
 entered at the beginning of the routine for the recursive function with a re
quest to save a given set of consecutive registers. A block of registers called
 the public push-down list is reserved for this purpose. The SAVE routine has
 an index that tells it how many registers in the push-down list are already
 in use. It moves the contents of the registers which are to be saved to the
 f
 irst unused registers in the push-down list, advances the index of the list, and
 returns to the program from which control came. This program may then
 freely use these registers for temporary storage. Before the routine exits it
 uses UNSAVE, which restores the contents of the temporary registers from
 the push-down list and moves back the index of this list. The result of these
 conventions is described, in programming terminology, by saying that the re
cursive subroutine is transparent to the temporary storage registers.
 f. Status of the LISP Programming System (February 1960). A variant of
 the function apply described in section 5f has been translated into a program
 APPLY for the IBM 704. Since this routine can compute values of S-functions
 given their descriptions as S-expressions and their arguments, it serves as an
 interpreter for the LISP programming language which describes computation
 processes in this way.
 The program APPLY has been imbedded in the LISP programming system
 which has the following features:
 1. The programmer maydefine anynumber ofS-functions by S-expressions.
 these functions may refer to each other or to certain S-functions represented
 by machine language program.
 2. The values of defined functions may be computed.
 3. S-expressions may be read and printed (directly or via magnetic tape).
 81995: now called a stack
 29
4. Some error diagnostic and selective tracing facilities are included.
 5. The programmer may have selected S-functions compiled into machine
 language programs put into the core memory. Values of compiled functions
 are computed about 60 times as fast as they would if interpreted. Compilation
 is fast enough so that it is not necessary to punch compiled program for future
 use.
 6. A “program feature” allows programs containing assignment and go to
 statements in the style of ALGOL.
 7. Computation with floating point numbers is possible in the system, but
 this is inefficient.
 8. A programmer’s manual is being prepared. The LISP programming
 system is appropriate for computations where the data can conveniently be
 represented as symbolic expressions allowing expressions of the same kind as
 subexpressions. A version of the system for the IBM 709 is being prepared.
 5 Another Formalism for Functions of Sym
bolic Expressions
 There are a number of ways of defining functions of symbolic expressions which
 are quite similar to the system we have adopted. Each of them involves three
 basic functions, conditional expressions, and recursive function definitions, but
 the class of expressions corresponding to S-expressions is different, and so are
 the precise definitions of the functions. We shall describe one of these variants
 called linear LISP.
 The L-expressions are defined as follows:
 1. A finite list of characters is admitted.
 2. Any string of admitted characters in an L-expression. This includes the
 null string denoted by Λ.
 There are three functions of strings:
 1. first[x] is the first character of the string x.
 first[Λ] is undefined. For example: first[ABC] = A
 2. rest[x] is the string of characters which remains when the first character
 of the string is deleted.
 rest[Λ] is undefined. For example: rest[ABC] = BC.
 3. combine[x;y] is the string formed by prefixing the character x to the
 string y. For example: combine[A;BC] = ABC
 30
There are three predicates on strings:
 1. char[x], x is a single character.
 2. null[x], x is the null string.
 3. x =y, defined for x and y characters.
 The advantage of linear LISP is that no characters are given special roles,
 as are parentheses, dots, and commas in LISP. This permits computations
 with all expressions that can be written linearly. The disadvantage of linear
 LISP is that the extraction of subexpressions is a fairly involved, rather than
 an elementary, operation. It is not hard to write, in linear LISP, functions that
 correspond to the basic functions of LISP, so that, mathematically, linear LISP
 includes LISP. This turns out to be the most convenient way of programming,
 in linear LISP, the more complicated manipulations. However, if the functions
 are to be represented by computer routines, LISP is essentially faster.
 6 Flowcharts and Recursion
 Since both the usual form of computer program and recursive function defi
nitions are universal computationally, it is interesting to display the relation
 between them. The translation of recursive symbolic functions into computer
 programs was the subject of the rest of this report. In this section we show
 how to go the other way, at least in principle.
 The state of the machine at any time during a computation is given by the
 values of a number of variables. Let these variables be combined into a vector
 ξ. Consider a program block with one entrance and one exit. It defines and is
 essentially defined by a certain function f that takes one machine configuration
 into another, that is, f has the form ξ′ = f(ξ). Let us call f the associated
 function of the program block. Now let a number of such blocks be combined
 into a program by decision elements π that decide after each block is completed
 which block will be entered next. Nevertheless, let the whole program still have
 one entrance and one exit.

 Wegive as an example the flowcart of figure 5. Let us describe the function
 r[ξ] that gives the transformation of the vector ξ between entrance and exit
 of the whole block. We shall define it in conjunction with the functions s(ξ),
 and t[ξ], which give the transformations that ξ undergoes between the points
 S and T, respectively, and the exit. We have
 r[ξ] = [π11[ξ] → S[f1[ξ]];T → S[f2[ξ]]]
 S[ξ] = [π21[ξ] → r[ξ];T → t[f3[ξ]]]
 t[ξ] = [π3I[ξ] → f4[ξ];π32[ξ] → r[ξ];T → t[f3[ξ]]]
 Given a flowchart with a single entrance and a single exit, it is easy to
 write down the recursive function that gives the transformation of the state
 vector from entrance to exit in terms of the corresponding functions for the
 computation blocks and the predicates of the branch. In general, we proceed
 as follows.
 In figure 6, let β be an n-way branch point, and let f1,···,fn be the
 computations leading to branch points β1,β2,···,βn. Let φ be the function

RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS OF SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS AND THEIR 
COMPUTATION BY MACHINE
 Introduction
 A programming system called LISP (for LISt Processor) has been developed for the 
IBM 704 computer by the Artificial Intelligence group. The system was designed to 
~~]
 facilitate experiments with a proposed system called the Advice Taker, whereby a 
machine could be instructed to handle declarative as well as imperative sentences and J
 could exhibit "common sense" in carrying out its instructions. The original proposal (1) 
for the Advice Taker was made in November 1958. The main requirement was a pro- 
gramming system for manipulating expressions representing formalized declarative and 
imperative sentences so that the Advice Taker system could make deductions.
 In the course of its development the LISP system went through several stages of 
simplification and eventually came to be based on a scheme for representing the partial 
recursive functions of a certain class of symbolic expressions. This representation is 
independent of the IBM 704 computer, or of any other electronic computer, and it now 
seems expedient to expound the system by starting with the class of expressions called 
S-expressions and the functions called S-functions.
 In this report we first describe the class of S-expressions and S-functions. Then we 
describe the representation of S-functions by S-expressions, which enables us to prove 
that all computable partial functions have been obtained, to obtain a universal S-function, 
and to exhibit a set of questions about S-expressions which cannot be decided by an S- 
function. We describe the representation of S-functions by programs in the IBM 704 
computer, and the representation of S-expressions by list structures similar to those 
]
 / 
used by Newell, Simon, and Shaw (2).
 Although we have not carried the development of recursive function theory in terms 
of S-functions and their representation by S-expressions beyond the simplest theorems, 
it seems that formulation of this theory in terms of S-functions has important advantages. 
Devices such as Godel numbering are unnecessary, and so is the construction of parti- 
cular Turing machines. (These constructions are all artificial in terms of what is 
intended to be accomplished by them.) The advantage stems from the fact that functions 
of symbolic expressions are easily and briefly described as S-expressions, and the 
representation of S-functions by S-expressions is trivial. Moreover, a large class of 
S-expression representations of S-functions translate directly into efficient machine

 Symbolic Knowledge Structures and Intuitive
 Knowledge Structures

 Abstract
 This paper proposes that two distinct types of structures are present
 in the brain: Symbolic Knowledge Structures (SKSs), used for formal sym
bolic reasoning, and Intuitive Knowledge Structures (IKSs), used for draw
ing informal associations. The paper contains ideas for modeling and an
alyzing these structures in an algorithmic style based on Spiking Neural
 Networks, following the paradigm of [9, 14, 5, 7]. The paper also con
tains two examples of use of these structures, involving counting through
 a memorized sequence, and understanding simple stylized sentences.
 Disclaimer: The ideas presented here are preliminary and speculative,
 and do not (yet) comprise a complete, coherent, algorithmic theory. That
 will require more thought and work. I hope that posting this preliminary
 version will help the ideas to evolve into such a theory.
 1 Introduction
 This work was originally motivated by trying to understand how language is
 processed in the human brain. Over time, the work has evolved so that now it
 focuses on two separate kinds of structures in the brain: one representing sym
bolic knowledge and one representing intuitive knowledge. An intuitive knowl
edge structure represents informally-understood concepts. It supports construc
tion of new concepts and relationships, as well as drawing informal associations
 between concepts, so that thoughts about some concepts may trigger thoughts
 about others. A symbolic knowledge structure, on the other hand, represents
 symbols (numbers, words, parts of speech, etc.), and supports formal, logical
 reasoning.
 ∗This work was supported by the National Science Foundation awards CCF-1810758 and
 CCF-2139936.
 1
These two types of structures, symbolic and intuitive, are used in language
 processing. A symbolic knowledge structure includes precise representations of
 linguistic elements such as words and parts of speech. It also encodes formal
 structures such as parse trees, and other relationships between linguistic ele
ments. An intuitive knowledge structure includes imprecise representations of
 concepts that are denoted by words and sentences, such as pictures and simple
 stories. It also encodes informally-understood relationships between concepts.
 However, language processing isn’t the only use for these structures. In an
 example I develop in this paper, one might memorize a sequence of symbols,
 each of which corresponds to some elaborate concept; for example, the successive
 letters in the Greek alphabet might be used to name the successive variants of
 an aggressive virus, or successive hurricanes in a particular year. Associated
 with each Greek letter is a collection of information about the virus variant or
 hurricane, which can be informally understood. The Greek names would appear
 in a symbolic knowledge structure, whereas the information about the virus or
 hurricane would appear in an intuitive knowledge structure.
 Yet another example might arise in planning a plumbing system, or other
 construction project. The plumbing system designer knows intuitively that wa
ter should flow in a pipe at approximately a certain natural rate—knowledge
 that lives in an intuitive knowledge structure. The designer must translate that
 intuitive requirement into precise angles at which to place the pipes; this part
 requires mathematical (symbolic) calculation, in a symbolic knowledge struc
ture.
 Myapproach in this paper is in terms of abstract models and algorithms, not
 in terms of actual areas of the human brain. This is the approach my co-workers
 and I have taken previously, in studying such problems as Winner-Take-All
 selection [9, 14], neural coding of complex data [5], and recognition and learning
 of hierarchical concepts [7]. It would be nice to (eventually) relate these abstract
 structures to brain areas. It seems plausible that the two kinds of structures
 considered here might reside in different areas of the brain, containing neurons
 with different characteristics. For example, a symbolic knowledge structure
 should be implemented using neurons that arereliable, with reliable connections.
 An intuitive knowledge structure could be built using less reliable neurons, with
 noisy connections.
 This division into symbolic knowledge structures and intuitive knowledge
 structures should be useful in understanding the differences between the intelli
gence of humans and other animals. Basically, both humans and many animals
 utilize intuitive knowledge and computation to understand their world and plan
 their activities. Humans also make extensive use of symbolic knowledge and
 computation.
 2 Model for Symbolic and Intuitive Knowledge
 This section contains a description of the proposed model. The following sec
tions, Sections 3-5, contain examples.
 2
The representation I envision for a set of related concepts consists of three
 main parts: an Intuitive Knowledge Structure (IKS), which stores intuitive con
cepts and their informal relationships, a Lexicon that stores symbols and some of
 their basic attributes, and a Symbolic Knowledge Structure (SKS), which stores
 symbols and their formal relationships. The SKS connects to the Lexicon and
 the IKS. Also, both the SKS and the IKS connect to input and output facilities,
 via special input and output neurons.
 In addition, I assume that we have a limited amount of Working Memory,
 consisting of neurons that can “point to” certain particular symbols or intuitive
 concepts that the brain is currently focusing on. These Working Memory neu
rons may represent special “roles” being played by the symbols or concepts, such
 as the “current number” in a series of numbers, a partial result in a calculation,
 or the subject in a sentence.
 The IKS contains entities (neurons, or collections of neurons) that represent
 intuitive concepts. Reasoning using the IKS is intuitive reasoning, which I might
 not even call “reasoning”—it is more like just following associations. The SKS
 contains entities that represent symbols. Reasoning using the SKS is logical,
 rather precise reasoning.
 I believe that the IKS is present in nearly all animals, not just humans. The
 Lexicon and the SKS, however, seem to be mostly characteristic of humans.
 Some research indicates that some apes may have rudimentary versions of these
 two structures, allowing them to process some symbols and perhaps perform
 some elementary symbolic manipulations (for example, see [11]). But in general,
 these structures are reserved for humans.
 In the rest of this section, I sketch how we might model the various compo
nents formally. My starting point is the synchronous, stochastic Spiking Neural
 Network (SNN) model of Lynch and Musco [8]. I expect that we will need
 to augment this model to include recent history, learning readiness, and other
 features.
 2.1 The Intuitive Knowledge Structure
 I begin by describing the Intuitive Knowledge Structure. In overview, the IKS
 consists of a collection of “concept neurons” and some directed connections
 between them. The neurons and the connections may be unreliable.
 It seems natural to model the IKS at two different levels of abstraction, where
 we think of the lower level as “implementing” the higher level. The higher level
 consists of individual neurons, with a single neuron representing each concept.
 Some pairs of neurons are connected by directed edges. The lower level may
 allow multiple neurons for the same concept. The use of multiple neurons may
 provide redundancy and increase reliability—so a lower-level model based on
 less reliable neurons can “implement” a higher-level model with more reliable
 neurons. I consider the question of whether the sets of neurons for different
 concepts can overlap, below.
 3
Higher-level model: Thehigher-levelmodel for the IKSis based ona weighted
 directed graph whose nodes correspond to concept neurons. This graph serves
 as the basis for a neural network model, similar to the one in [8]: at each round,
 each neuron exhibits firing behavior based on its total incoming potential, as
 described in [8]. This incoming potential is the sum of the weights of the in
coming edges from currently-firing incoming neighbors. The graph is dynamic:
 it may change over time as concepts get learned, get seen together, get seen in
 apparent causal relationships, and so on.
 This IKS model may include some unreliability, both in neurons and in
 connections. To model unreliability in the neurons, note that the sigmoid func
tion that is used in translating incoming potential to firing probability (see [8])
 yields stochastic behavior; shallower sigmoid functions yield more uncertainty.
 We might also associate a failure probability with each neuron; failure of a neu
ron might mean that it doesn’t fire even if its incoming potential indicates that
 it should, or fires even if it is not supposed to. To model unreliability in connec
tions, we might introduce a probability distribution for the potential conveyed
 on each edge, rather than using a fixed value. We might also associate a failure
 probability with each edge; failure of an edge might mean that it doesn’t con
vey potential, or conveys a different potential from what it should. We might
 consider other failure modes, temporary or permanent.
 I imagine that the IKS is constructed using operations like those presented
 by Valiant [15], and Papadimitriou and Vempals [3], notably the Join operation,
 also known as Merge. In this work, performing a Join/Merge involves creating
 an entirely new concept that is built from other concepts, that is, a hierarchical
 concept. Another operation is Associate, also known as Link. These operations
 can be used to construct the IKS, and help to determine its structure. Other
 structural relationships that might appear in the IKS include causality and
 temporal predictions.
 For some purposes, we will probably want additional structure in the IKS,
 besides just neurons and directed edges. For example, we might want to include
 the information that one concept neuron is a “child” of another concept neuron.
 That is, we might classify some of the directed edges as parent edges or child
 edges, as in [7]. For a sequence, we might have successor edges and predecessor
 edges. For a sentence, we might have subject edges and predicate edges. Other
 labels might be appropriate for other kinds of relationships. We also might want
 multiple edges, with different labels, between the same pairs of neurons. Thus,
 in general, our model will be not just a weighted directed graph, but a labeled,
 weighted, directed multigraph.
 Whatever type of graph we use, we will need to develop a Spiking Neural
 Network model based on it. This will require extending the model of [8].1
 We can consider several general kinds of operations to be performed on the
 IKS, with varying latencies.
 1It is straightforward to extend that model to include multiple edges. For edge labels, we
 may need other machinery. For example, we might want to have external signals that turn all
 edges with certain labels on, or turn them all off.
 4
1. Direct recognition of concepts: When an input is presented for one of
 the concepts in the IKS (in whatever form we allow for inputs, see Sec
tion 2.4), it can cause a particular neuron, or neurons, to fire. This should
 happen very fast, in milliseconds. This might also trigger some outputs
 (in whatever form we allow for outputs, see Section 2.4).
 This kind of operation corresponds to recognizing something directly, and
 responding in some automatic way. This is “fast thinking”, in Kahneman’s
 terminology [6].
 2. Indirect recognition of concepts: An input is presented, but instead of
 causing immediate recognition, it triggers a cascade of neurons firing. This
 might result in an output. This overall process should still be fast, because
 each link is fast, as long as we are not talking about too long a chain of
 links.
 This corresponds to producing a collection of associations for the input
 concept. Probably this is still “fast thinking”, in Kahneman’s sense, since
 it is automatic, and each step of the cascade is very fast.
 The behavior the network exhibits in such a cascade is as follows: Input
 of some sort arrives, triggering some particular concept neurons to fire.
 These cause potential to flow to their outgoing neighbor concept neurons.
 If these receive enough potential, they fire with some probability, based on
 their sigmoid firing function (and possibly other uncertainty). Thus, the
 effect of inputs is somewhat unpredictable, based on how this uncertainty
 is resolved. The overall result from the input is a somewhat unpredictable
 cascade of firing of related concepts.
 3. Learning of concepts or relationships: Some concept or relationship inputs
 are presented, causing new concepts or new relationships to be learned.
 Also, already-learned concepts and relationships could have their repre
sentations strengthened when they are presented again.
 Learning a new concept should involve associating the new concept with
 an unused internal neuron, plus strengthening the weights of edges that
 connect the input neurons encoding the concept to the internal repre
senting neuron. This process might use a Winner-Take-All mechanism to
 select a suitable unused neuron, as in [7]. Reinforcing a concept might
 involve strengthening these edge weights.
 Learning a new relationship between two concepts, or strengthening an
 existing relationship, should involve increasing the weights of edges that
 connect the concepts to each other.
 These learning operations should be fairly slow—seconds, or minutes.
 They use some form of Hebbian learning, such as Oja’s rule [10].
 So far, the structure and behavior of this model appear to correspond well
 to Valiant’s work [15].
 5
What about outputs? Among the concept neurons in the IKS, we can iden
tify some as output neurons, which represent certain decisions. For example,
 the decision may be an evaluation of a situation as “good”, “neutral”, “bad”,
 or “terrible”. These neurons can also trigger emotional responses, like “happy”,
 “sad”, “scared”, or “angry”, probably by activating other neurons outside the
 IKS.
 It should be possible to prove some simple theoretical latency bounds for
 the various kinds of operations on the IKS. The recognition operations should
 be analyzed in terms of parameters representing time for a single round of
 execution, that is, for one step in the synchronous Lynch-Musco model, and the
 depth of a cascade of firing. The learning time would depend on the time for a
 single round of execution, and on the particular learning rule that is used. For
 example, Lynch and Mallmann-Trenn [7] analyzed the time required to learn a
 hierarchical concept, using a particular Oja-style learning rule.
 Lower-level model: The lower-level graph is defined as a redundant version
 of a given higher-level graph. Each concept c represented in the higher-level
 graph has some number m of neurons in the lower-level graph; to make things
 simple here, we assume the same number m of neurons for every concept. The
 edges are replicated, connecting every neuron representing one concept c1 to
 every neuron representing another concept c2 if and only if the unique repre
senting neurons for c1 and c2 are connected in the higher-level graph.2 As for
 the higher-level model, this model may be dynamic, and may include some un
reliability. As before, we will want to allow multi-edges and labels, and we will
 need a neural network model based on this graph model.
 The lower-level model supports the same kinds of operations as the higher
level model. The direct and indirect recognition operations should work in
 essentially the same way as before, except that now the inputs will trigger
 multiple representing neurons to fire, propagation of firing will involve all the
 replicas, and the final output neurons will receive their potential from multiple
 internal neurons. The learning operations will also involve replication, in that
 the same learning rule will be applied on all the edges that correspond to a
 single higher-level edge. However, since the behavior of each individual neuron
 is stochastic, the behavior of the different replicas for the same concept will tend
 to diverge as the cascade proceeds.
 An intriguing question is whether we should allow the sets of neurons repre
senting different concepts to overlap. Valiant, and Papadimitriou and Vempala,
 allow such overlap; in particular, Papadimitriou and Vempala analyze overlap in
 detail, in their work on computing with assemblies of neurons [3]. Based on their
 simulations, Papadimitriou and Vempala observe that the set of neurons that
 represent a particular concept may shift over time, in response to presentations
 of the concept in relationship with other concepts.
 An alternative hypothesis that seems consistent with the results in [3] is
 that the set of representing neurons for each concept c is fixed, and does not
 2This could be weakened to allow somewhat less connectivity.
 6
change over time. However, instead of observing the firing of a large set of
 representing neurons for a concept c that shifts over time, we might observe the
 f
 iring of a large set of neurons that participate in a multi-step firing cascade,
 initiated by the firing of a smaller, fixed set of actual representing neurons for
 c. When two concepts are presented together, the connections between them
 strengthen, because of Hebbian learning. Then afterwards, presentation of one
 of the concepts is likely to trigger firing of the representing neurons of the
 other, as part of a firing cascade. This might make it look like c has a larger,
 changing set of representing neurons, whereas actually, it has a smaller, fixed
 set of neurons, with changing edge weights.
 Relationship between the two levels: The low-level model adds redun
dancy to the high-level model, but otherwise operates similarly. The key differ
ence should be an increase in reliability, where many less-reliable neurons and
 edges at the lower level can be used to simulate more-reliable neurons and edges
 at the higher level. This should lead to increased overall reliability.
 Once we have formal definitions of both the higher-level and lower-level
 models, we should describe a formal correspondence between the two system
 models and use it to prove that the less-reliable lower-level IKS model cor
rectly simulates the more-reliable higher-level model. The correspondence will
 define formal relationships between the states of the two system models, and
 between their transitions. Since the systems are probabilistic, we would need to
 consider simulations specifically designed for probabilistic systems, such as the
 ones studied by Canetti, Cheung, et al. [2], and Lynch and Segala [13].
 2.2 The Lexicon
 The Lexicon stores symbols, along with some associated attributes, in a way
 that supports fast random access. “Random access” here simply means that
 the firing of certain external neurons directly triggers the firing of neurons in
 the Lexicon, with no complex access mechanism involved. A substantial Lexicon
 seems to be characteristic of humans, and does not seem to be present in other
 animals.
 Formally, the Lexicon contains one (or perhaps a small number) of neurons
 for each symbol that it stores. Input encoding a symbol is presented somehow,
 from outside the Lexicon, and triggers firing of the corresponding neurons in the
 Lexicon. This input may come from several possible sources: the outside world
 through vision, listening, or reading; corresponding symbol neurons in the SKS;
 or corresponding informal concept neurons in the IKS. It is also plausible that
 the input from the outside world might not trigger the neurons in the Lexicon
 directly, but just indirectly, though symbol neurons in the SKS or IKS; these
 interactions remain to be defined.
 In the human brain, I assume the Lexicon could be implemented in the
 neocortex. This is consistent with the fact that humans have large and highly
 developed neocortexes, and also can store a very large number of symbols. Also,
 7
the neocortex has a fairly uniform structure, which is consistent with the needs
 of a large random-access store.
 2.3 The Symbolic Knowledge Structure
 The symbolic knowledge structure (SKS) consists of a collection of “symbol
 neurons” and some directed connections between them. The neurons and con
nections should be more reliable than those in the IKS. Reliability for neurons
 may mean sharp thresholds (or at least, extremely steep sigmoid functions),
 plus no other types of failures. Reliability for connections means that poten
tial is conveyed accurately. As for the IKS, we model the SKS at two levels of
 abstraction.
 Higher-level model: Abstractly, the SKS is another labeled, weighted, di
rected multigraph. The nodes of this digraph are “symbol neurons”, which are
 separate from the corresponding symbol neurons in the Lexicon. There are reli
able edges between the corresponding symbol neurons in the SKS and Lexicon,
 in both directions. The graph is dynamic, changing in response to presentation
 of new concepts and combinations of concepts.
 The SKS can be constructed using operations like those used for the IKS,
 such as Join/Merge and Associate/Link. However, more interesting special-case
 structures (such as sequences, parse trees, mathematical proofs,...) can also be
 built in the SKS, under purposeful control from the outside. This may use
 Working Memory.
 The SKS is also connected to input mechanisms (visual, auditory) and out
put mechanisms. Each symbol neuron can be triggered by symbolic inputs, like
 hearing a particular word spoken. Likewise, the neuron can trigger symbolic
 outputs, like saying the word. Another important input/output mechanism for
 symbols involves reading and writing. Reading and writing differ from speech
 input/output in that they have the pleasant effect of expanding the SKS, in
creasing its size by utilizing paper or computer storage. Thus, humans can
 write down a long list of items, or a complicated math proof, or a very large
 parse tree. These symbolic structures can be much larger than what humans
 can remember, or manipulate, in their internal SKS structures.3
 Furthermore, and crucially, the SKS is directly connected to the IKS. Specif
ically, each symbol neuron in the SKS connects to one or more related concept
 neurons in the IKS. There should be a strong and reliable connection from each
 symbol neuron to each of its corresponding intuitive concept neurons, and vice
 versa.4
 3Another example of expanding the SKS is the process of “counting on our fingers”. Mostly
 everyone over the age of five knows a correspondence between our fingers and the numbers
 one through ten, and can use that for counting items in the real world. We can also use our
 f
 ingers to help us count symbols in a sequence that is memorized in the SKS.
 4It seems clear that humans can generally move quickly from a symbol neuron to any of
 its corresponding intuitive concept neurons. The reverse is also usually true, but there are
 exceptions—when you just can’t think of the name for some concept that you “know”!
 8
Again, we can consider several kinds of operations to be performed on the
 SKS, with different latencies:
 1. Direct recognition of symbols: As for the IKS, when an input is presented
 for one of the symbols in the SKS, it causes a particular neuron, or neurons,
 to fire. As for the IKS, this should happen very fast, in milliseconds. This
 might also trigger symbolic outputs. In addition, the firing of a symbol
 neuron in the SKS will trigger firing of the corresponding neuron in the
 Lexicon.
 As before, this corresponds to recognizing a symbol quickly and directly,
 and perhaps responding in some automatic way. As for the IKS, this part
 of the usage of the SKS corresponds to Kahneman’s fast thinking. An
 example here is direct translation, such as hearing a spoken word and
 outputting a written version.
 2. Multistep symbolic computation: An input is presented, and it triggers
 some type of symbolic computation in the SKS. For example, a number k
 may be input, and the number k +2 should be output. Or two numbers
 may be input and their sum should be output. Another example, which
 I will explore in Sections 3 and 4, involves inputting a number k and
 outputting the kth element in a sequence that is memorized within the
 SKS.
 Another example, which I will discuss in Section 5, involves inputting a
 stream of words, and having the SKS determine whether or not the words
 form a syntactically correct sentence having a predetermined simple struc
ture, say, a noun (the subject), followed by a transitive verb, followed by
 another noun (the object). The SKS might also output a representation
 of the sentence structure, such as a parse tree. More generally, the SKS
 might determine whether the sentence fits any of a predetermined finite
 set of sentence structures, or fits any correct sentence structure. Other ex
amples of multistep symbolic computation might include solving algebraic
 equations.
 The latency required for such operations varies, of course. For recognizing
 simple sentences, the response should be very fast: people parse simple
 sentences almost immediately after the input has been fully presented. But
 processing even a simple sentence isn’t trivial: it requires finding the words
 in the SKS and the Lexicon, and fitting them into some representation of
 the sentence structure, such as a parse tree. Doing all of this fast might
 require that the sentence structure be built into the SKS ahead of time, so
 that what remains to be done is just fitting the arriving words into their
 proper places. For more complicated sentences, time is also required for
 determining the sentence structure.
 Counting, or more elaborate arithmetic calculations, will give a slower re
sponse, on the order of seconds. These require multi-step calculations, and
 following paths in the SKS. They also require attention, and purposeful
 9
focus on particular parts of the computation. This focus will involve the
 use of Working Memory (see below), and perhaps some form of Winner
Take-All mechanism [9]. This type of computation should correspond to
 Kahneman’s slow thinking.
 All of these multi-step computations in the IKS should be precise and
 reliable, in contrast to multi-step computations in the IKS.
 3. Computation involving both the SKS and the IKS: The simplest case in
volves computation in the SKS, followed by triggering of neurons in the
 IKS and cascades of firing in the IKS. Our examples in Sections 3-5 are
 all of this type. More complicated cases would involve more elaborate
 interactions between the SKS and IKS.
 In the simplest case, input is presented, and it triggers some symbolic
 calculation in the SKS. The firing of some of the symbol neurons in the
 SKS triggers the firing of their corresponding concept neurons in the IKS.
 These, in turn, trigger a cascade of firing in the IKS, eventually resulting
 in some output. For example, inputting the number k triggers firing of
 a symbol neuron for the symbol 7 in the SKS, which in turn can trigger
 f
 iring of some concept neuron for that number. The IKS then produces
 a cascade of associations for that concept; for instance, for the number
 7, we can get the concept of seven deadly sins, seven samurai, or seven
 dwarfs. An output might be a rudimentary mental picture of one of these.
 The latency for this sort of operation is only a bit more than that for the
 multistep calculations within the SKS, because the computation in the
 IKS is fast.
 In a more complicated case, the semantics and intuitive associations for
 words, which arise in the IKS, can help the SKS in determining a sensible
 parse tree for a given input sentence. Another interesting interaction arises
 in solving a math problem: Here, the problem is input to the IKS, which
 uses its intuitive reasoning to produce ideas for solving the problem. These
 trigger the SKS to perform some formal calculations, producing partial
 results. These partial results then serve as new inputs to the IKS, which
 uses them to produce more ideas, and so on. The latency for such complex
 operations is essentially the sum of all the computation times in the IKS
 and SKS during all the phases of the interaction.
 4. Learning of concepts or relationships: Analogously to the IKS, the SKS
 can be modified by adding new symbol nodes and new connections, and
 by strengthening existing connections. Learning a new symbol should be
 as in the IKS, using some generic process for selecting an unused neuron.
 Again, this may use a Winner-Take-All mechanism.
 However, adding or strengthening connections between neurons should
 be different in the SKS from in the IKS: instead of using incremental
 Hebbian rules to strengthen edges that are frequently used, the SKS may
 make bigger, “all-at-once” increases in weights. This makes sense in view
 10
of the assumption that the changes in the SKS are produced purposefully,
 triggered by some external stimulus, rather than emerging accidentally
 as a result of random experiences. Making larger changes should lead to
 faster learning than an incremental Hebbian learning process.
 Lower level model: At a lower level of abstraction, the SKS can be repre
sented by another labeled, weighted, directed multi-graph, in which each con
cept has some number m of representing neurons, with all such sets disjoint.
 Edges can be similarly replicated. All this is as for the IKS, but we do not
 allow overlapping sets of neurons here. This ensures that the lower-level model
 for the SKS maintains clear separation between the representations of different
 symbols. This seems to be necessary for reliable computation.
 As for the IKS, the lower-level SKS model supports the same operations as
 the higher-level model. As for the IKS, the redundancy in the lower-level SKS
 model should yield greater reliability in the higher-level SKS model.
 Comparison between processing in the SKS and IKS: Processing in
 the SKS models is somewhat different from processing in their IKS counter
parts. For one thing, I assume that the individual elements of the SKS models
 are more reliable than those in the IKS models, which implies that processing
 should be generally more reliable. But also, there is a difference between the
 kinds of computations that are carried out in these two structures. In the IKS,
 when neurons fire, they trigger neighboring neurons to fire, according to general
 stochastic firing rules. On the other hand, the SKS is subject to more external
 control, which chooses which symbols to focus on and guides the computation
 step-by-step. An external mechanism probably helps in keeping track of inter
mediate results of the computation—see Section 2.5 for a discussion of Working
 Memory. Thus, the SKS can carry out precise, systematic computations, such
 as arithmetic calculations, whereas the IKS just produces general associations.
 2.4 Input and output
 Both the Symbolic and Intuitive Knowledge Structures accept inputs and pro
duce outputs.
 Inputs: In both the SKS andIKS, inputs arrive via special input neurons. For
 the SKS, these inputs encode symbols, and for the IKS, they encode intuitive
 concepts. The encoding scheme may depend on the type of input. For example,
 number inputs to the SKS could be input in unary or binary. For the IKS, we
 could have a unique input neuron for each intuitive concept, or a set of neurons
 (possibly with overlap between the sets for different concepts), or even a binary
 code. The inputs can be visual, auditory, written, olfactory, or tactile. Visual
 input might be provided using a feature vector, as in machine learning.
 11
Outputs: For the SKS, the outputs take the form of symbolic output, which
 might be drawn, written, spoken, or gestured. For the IKS, the outputs may be
 general impressions, such as an assessment of whether something is good, bad,
 or terrible, or it could be an emotional response. The SKS outputs could also
 be triggers for motor actions.
 2.5 Working memory
 The final component of the knowledge system is something I call the Working
 Memory. This is essential for computation in the SKS.5 The Working Memory
 contains a limited number of neurons that are used to keep track of intermediate
 results in an SKS computation. I think of the Working Memory neurons as
 representing “roles” in a computation, to be filled by specific numbers, words,
 or other symbols during computation. It might be useful to think of them as
 pointers into the SKS structure.
 For example, in a counting process, one Working Memory neuron might keep
 track of the number k that the system is up to in the count. If the system is
 counting symbols in a memorized sequence, another Working Memory neuron
 might keep track of the current symbol in the sequence. If the system is counting
 up to some goal number g (for example, because it is counting up to the gth
 element in a memorized sequence), then a third Working Memory neuron might
 indicate the goal. For parsing a simple sentence, the Working Memory might
 keep track of the subject, predicate, and object in the sentence.
 Implementing Working Memory: An important question is exactly how
 we should implement the Working Memory in a Spiking Neural Network model,
 specifically, how to represent the idea that a “role neuron” in Working Memory
 “points to” a particular symbol neuron in the SKS. We can’t actually store a
 pointer in a neuron, as we do in a programming system, so we need to emulate
 this connection somehow.
 One idea is to say that a role neuron points to a symbol neuron at a certain
 time t if and only if the two neurons both fire at that same time t. We might
 interpret this as meaning that the Working Memory is paying attention to, or
 focusing on, a particular symbol, at time t. In this case, we might say that the
 role neuron is “bound to” its current corresponding symbol neuron. We might
 strengthen this condition by requiring that the role neuron and symbol neuron
 f
 ire together for some number of consecutive times. Perhaps other conditions
 will need to be added.
 But this has an obvious problem: the same role neuron can fire together
 with two (or more) symbol neurons. So according to this definition, that would
 mean that one role neuron is pointing to more than one neuron at the same
 time. This does not seem too sensible if the binding between role neurons
 5I think it is very likely that a rudimentary type of Working Memory could also be used
 with the IKS, allowing the brain to focus attention on some intuitive concept without naming
 it with a symbol. But I will not discuss that here.
 12
and symbol neurons is supposed to represent focus. One way out might be to
 have the system maintain an invariant that prohibits such “split attention”.
 Implementing such an invariant might require a Winner-Take-All mechanism.
 Other technical issues arise, for example:
 • Suppose that we have two role neurons, each pointing to its own symbol
 neuron. In that case, we could allow all four neurons to fire together, but
 this seems confusing. It might be cleaner to separate the firing for the
 different bindings, for example, alternating the firing of the two pairs of
 neurons according to some simple pattern.6
 • What about two role neurons that point to the same symbol neuron? In
 that case, we could allow all three neurons to fire together. But again, an
 alternation discipline would probably be cleaner here: at some times, one
 role neuron fires along with the symbol neuron, and at other times, the
 other role neuron fires along with the same symbol neuron.
 Just having a role neuron and a symbol neuron firing together, in some pat
tern, doesn’t give us very much. We have to understand how this synchronized
 f
 iring helps in performing computation in the SKS, for example, in counting.
 Some preliminary thoughts about this appear in Section 4. For now, we just
 leave this as:
 Open question 1: Devise a concrete SNN mechanism for implementing a
 Working Memory, based on synchronizing role neurons and symbol neurons.
 Give specific examples of how this mechanism can be used in symbolic reasoning.
 2.6 Humans vs. animals
 Considering two knowledge structures, intuitive and symbolic, may help us to
 understand differences in thinking between humans and other animals. Non
human primates and other mammals have very well developed intuitive knowl
edge structures, in some ways better than humans’ structures, at least for the
 types of concepts that are important for the animals’ survival and comfort. I
 imagine that this structure is very similar to intuitive knowledge structure in
 humans.
 Thus, like a human’s IKS, an animal’s IKS is a labeled, weighted, directed
 multigraph, with unreliable nodes and edges. It connects to visual, auditory,
 and olfactory input neurons, and decision, emotion, an motor action output
 neurons. It receives input signals, which trigger a cascade of firings, which
 eventually trigger output behavior. It also supports learning, in that inputs can
 cause modifications to this structure, using Hebbian-style rules.
 However, I believe that animals have only a small, rudimentary symbolic
 knowledge structure (SKS), if any. Some animals (the most advanced apes)
 6Implementing such alternation might involve using some neurons as memories, along the
 lines of work by Hitron et al. [5].
 13
seem to be able to acquire a small vocabulary of symbols and use them in sim
ple ways [11, 12]. These should be able to fit into a small Lexicon, and might be
 processed in simple ways using a rudimentary SKS. We might say that animals
 that exhibit some basic ability to use symbols have a limited form of this funda
mentally human characteristic. I don’t consider that to be a contradiction, only
 an indication of the beginnings of a human capability in some higher primates.
 Can we match the theoretical IKS and SKS structures with actual areas of
 the human brain? For example, can we map the SKS to some part of the left
 brain and the IKS to some part of the right brain? Also, Friederici [4] provides
 evidence that certain connections between brain areas involved in language pro
cessing are much stronger in adult humans than in animals (or infant humans).
 Can we match these real connections with theoretical connections between the
 SKS and IKS?
 Language processing: What is the relationship between the SKS/IKS di
chotomy and language processing? I think it is natural to regard a parse tree,
 and more generally, the collection of parse trees representing the possible struc
tures of sentences in a language, as a symbolic knowledge structure. Let’s
 assume for now that this collection of possible parse trees is already memorized
 in the SKS, and not worry now about how it got there, whether by learning or
 evolution.
 Then what happens when a person hears (or reads) a sentence? They match
 up the words of the sentence with leaves in the parse trees in the SKS, and
 larger parts of the sentence with internal nodes in the parse trees. Somehow,
 this happens very quickly, at least for sentences with simple structure (such as
 3-word (noun, transitive verb, noun) sentences). The process of parsing a simple
 sentence may use Working Memory to describe the “roles” of the major parts of
 the sentence, such as subject, predicate, and object. It may also use semantic
 knowledge from the IKS, to help in disambiguating the sentence. Viewed in this
 way, the problem of parsing a sentence is a special case of symbolic computation
 in the SKS, possibly with some contribution from intuitive processing in the IKS.
 So then, what is the most important difference between human and animal
 capabilities with respect to language processing? I believe it is just that humans
 have a well-developed SKS that is capable of representing and manipulating
 formal relationships among linguistic symbols.
 Berwick and Chomsky’s theory of linguistic processing [1] reaches a rather
 different conclusion. They propose that the key difference is the ability of hu
mans to build arbitrarily complex hierarchical mental structures, such as com
plex sentences, using Merge operations and recursive grammar rules.
 I don’t think that can be exactly right. I have three comments. First,
 the Join/Merge operation, as studied, for example, by Valiant, seems to be
 applicable for intuitive concepts in the IKS, at least as much as for symbols in
 the SKS. Since the IKS is present in both humans and animals, it is likely that
 animals can perform simple intuitive Merges. In fact, I suspect that there is
 little difference between the abilities of humans and higher animals to construct
 14
intuitive hierarchies in the IKS.
 Second, when we talk about recursive grammar rules, we are talking about
 sophisticated symbol manipulations, which humans can do and animals cannot.
 Then we are in the realm of symbolic reasoning, which involves the SKS.
 And third, I don’t think that humans can actually construct arbitrarily
 complex hierarchies in their SKSs. For instance, it seems to me that a human
 can keep track of only three or four levels of structural depth in a sentence’s
 parse tree. The SKS in the human brain probably has some graph-theoretic
 limitations, which impose limits on the size and depth of the linguistic structures
 that can be represented. Also, perhaps understanding a sentence with very
 complex structure requires focusing on a large number of symbols at once—
 more than can be handled in Working Memory.7
 At any rate, it seems to me that the important distinction in linguistic abil
ities is simply that humans can do sophisticated symbolic processing, whereas
 animals cannot.
 In Sections 3-5, I give two examples to illustrate the ideas of Section 2. We
 focus on the case where the structures of interest are already learned, and men
tion learning only later, in Section 6. Our examples involve traversing sequences
 of symbols and parsing simple sentences.
 3 Sequences
 To make the ideas of Section 2 more concrete, I define here here a simplified,
 special case of a symbolic knowledge structure, namely, a memorized finite se
quence of distinct symbols. Using this SKS, one might compute, for example,
 the symbol that appears in a particular position in the sequence. Following this
 computation with further computation using an intuitive knowledge structure
 might produce some reactions related to a concept denoted by this symbol.
 3.1 Representation
 Let’s consider a finite sequence of k distinct symbols, s1,s2,...,sk. Let S denote
 the set of symbols in the sequence.
 We assume that the SKS is a linear directed graph, with nodes (= neurons)
 corresponding to the k symbols. Denote the node for symbol s by rep(s). These
 nodes are connected in increasing sequential order, where each rep(si) has a
 directed edge to rep(si+1). In addition, each rep node has a self-loop. Weights
 on all these edges are positive, so that firing of one rep node at one time t
 encourages the firing of the next rep node in the sequence, and also encourages
 its own firing, at time t+1. We assume that the nodes are threshold elements or
 7Of course, if we expand the SKS and Working Memory by writing things down on paper,
 as humans can do, then much more complex hierarchies could be represented. But this is not
 a fair comparison—let’s stick to the internal capabilities of the brain.
 15
have their firing determined by very steep sigmoids, and all components behave
 reliably.
 The IKS contains one or more intuitive concept neurons for each symbol in
 the SKS. These connect to other concepts using positive weight edges, in arbi
trary ways. Concept neurons for the successive elements of S are not connected
 to each other in a systematic pattern. The neurons may use shallow sigmoids,
 and the components need not behave completely reliably.
 For each symbol s ∈ S, we also have directed edges between rep(s) and each
 intuitive concept neuron for s, in both directions.
 Example: The Greek alphabet and virus variants: We consider the
 sequence of 24 Greek letters, alpha, beta, ..., omega. This can be memorized in
 the SKS, in the manner just described.
 Each Greek letter is associated with numerous intuitive concepts, includ
ing mathematical notions, hurricanes, and most importantly for this paper, a
 variant of a certain aggressive virus. Each of these intuitive concepts has a
 corresponding intuitive concept node in the IKS.
 For example, consider virus variants. For this paper, we pretend that every
 Greek letter has exactly one associated virus variant.8 Loosely associated with
 a virus variant are many of its properties, including where it originated, how
 contagious it was, how serious an impact it had, approximately how many people
 caught it, whether it caused widespread business and and school shut-downs,
 whether a lot of people died, etc. This is all informal understanding, and is
 represented by nodes and edges in the IKS. These thoughts are all produced
 quickly, along the lines of Kahneman’s fast thinking.
 In order to define abstract problems involving Greek letters and virus vari
ants, we also include special output neurons in the IKS. These can represent
 informal decisions about the virus variant, such as whether the variant was OK,
 bad, or terrible. They can also represent emotional reactions, such as neutral,
 scary, or terrifying.
 3.2 Queries
 We define two natural queries for sequences, both of which involve counting
 symbols and evaluating associated intuitive concepts. Answering them will in
volve a combination of symbolic and intuitive reasoning. For these queries, we
 assume that each symbol neuron has exactly one corresponding intuitive concept
 neuron.
 1. The input is a “goal number” g in the allowed range 1,...,k, where k is
 the length of the sequence. The output should be a decision, or emotional
 reaction, derived from the firings in the IKS starting from rep(sg).
 8For the COVID virus, that is not quite true: we are currently not done with the list, but
 are stalled at omicron. Also, someone decided to skip the letters nu and xi, for reasons that
 should be easy to guess.
 16
What is the “correct” response for this query? This is defined by the
 structure—edges and weights—of the relevant part of the IKS, which can
 be arbitrary. According to the IKS execution rules, when the concept
 neuron rep(sg) fires, it triggers a cascade of firing of other IKS neurons.
 This yields a probability distribution on decision neurons, or emotional
 reaction neurons, that are reached by the cascade, by any particular time.
 We require that the output for the query follow this distribution.
 In the most interesting case, the IKS operation guarantees that, for some
 time t, with very high probability, the firing decision or emotional re
action neuron is unique, and moreover, that the firing pattern for deci
sion/emotion neurons persists from time t onward. In this case, the query
 response should also stabilize to a unique value by some time t, with high
 probability.
 2. There are two inputs, a symbol s in the set S and a goal number g in
 the range {1,...,k − i}, where s = si. The output should be the correct
 decision or emotional reaction, derived from the firings in the IKS starting
 from rep(si+g).
 The correct response for this query is defined as in the first query, based
 on IKS behavior starting from rep(si+g).
 Answering the queries: The first issue that must be addressed, for process
ing queries like these, is the representation of their inputs. In this case, how does
 one input a number in {1,...,k}? How does one input a symbol s? I propose
 that, for now, we consider the simplest possibilities:
 • For numbers in {1,...,k}, use simple unary representation. Assume we
 have a dedicated input neuron for each number in this range, which is
 triggered to fire by some external stimulus, in order to input the number.
 • For symbols in S, we could allocate one input neuron for each symbol.
 As it happens, the processing of these two queries can be broken down into
 sequential phases: provide symbolic inputs, use symbolic computation to iden
tify a particular symbol neuron in the SKS, move to the corresponding intuitive
 concept neuron in the IKS, and then let the cascade in the IKS produce the final
 result. One could also consider queries whose processing involves more elabo
rate interactions between the two structures; examples of this sort might arise,
 for example, in parsing and understanding sentences. But for now, let’s focus
 on these simple Queries 1 and 2, with their stylized one-way communication
 pattern between the SKS and IKS.
 During the symbolic processing phase of these queries, we will also use the
 Working Memory, to keep track of particular symbols that the computation is
 currently focusing on.
 So how might the answers to Queries 1 and 2 be computed? For Query 1,
 we will count up to the input goal number g, moving step-by-step through a
 17
sequence of neurons representing consecutive positive integers. As we do this,
 for each step, we also move one step in the sequential SKS. When we reach
 the number g, we must recognize that we have reached it, and identify the
 associated intuitive concept neuron. The firing of this neuron starts the cascade
 that eventually produces the ouput. It remains to express this strategy as a
 formal SNN; a start at this appears in Section 4.
 Query 2 will be answered similarly. This time, we start at the symbol neuron
 in the SKS that is indicated by the symbol input. Again, we traverse the SKS
 while counting up to the input number g, then continue processing in the IKS.
 Thus, both of these queries involve simple linear traversals of the SKS, while
 counting the number of steps that have been traversed.
 Example: The Greek alphabet and virus variants: For Query 1, we
 have k = 24, so the goal number input is any number g ∈ {1,...,24}. The
 output is an assessment of how bad the virus variant was that was associated
 with the Greek letter at position g in the Greek alphabet. For example, input
 4 gives the delta variant, which might produce output “terrible” based on the
 number of cases and deaths. Similarly, for Query 2, we ask how bad the virus
 variant was that is associated with the Greek letter in position g after the variant
 symbolized by s.
 Complexity analysis: When we define formal SNN algorithms for answering
 these queries, we would like some way of measuring their computational com
plexity. I focus here on latency, measured in terms of the number of basic steps
 in the SNN model.
 The strategies outlined above involve computation in the SKS followed by
 computation in the IKS. In this special case, we can obtain a bound on latency
 simply by adding the time bounds for these two phases of computation (plus
 one extra step for the time from when the final symbol neuron fires to when its
 corresponding intuitive concept neuron fires).
 The time for computation in the IKS is the time from when the initial intu
itive concept neuron fires until a decision or emotion neuron fires persistently.
 This corresponds to the time to follow some number of links in the IKS, plus
 perhaps some time to suppress all but one candidate decision. We don’t know
 the number of links, and it is not clear yet how many candidate decisions there
 will be, nor exactly how one decision will be selected. So for now, we encapsu
late all this in a parameter, tiks. In any case, this should be a small number,
 qualifying as fast thinking in Kahneman’s sense.
 The time for computation in the SKS will be the time to follow g links in
 the SKS, focusing on one link at a time. It is not clear how long it will take to
 follow a single link, so for now, we make this another parameter, tsks. Then the
 total time for each of the queries would be roughly gtsks + tiks + 1.
 In Section 4, we give some technical details for possible mechanisms for
 answering these queries. The reader may want to skip that section for now, and
 move on to our other example, in Section 5.
 18
4 More Details for Reasoning about Sequences
 Here I consider theoretical mechanisms that might be involved in answering
 queries like those in Section 3.
 We need a mechanism for counting up to the gth symbol in the memorized
 sequence. I assume that Working Memory includes three neurons, a current
number neuron that keeps track of a natural number k representing where we
 are up to in the count, a current-symbol neuron that keeps track of the corre
sponding symbol in the sequence, and a goal neuron that holds the goal number
 g. These neurons represent three distinct “roles”, which will, during the com
putation, synchronize with particular symbol neurons that fill these roles.
 We must pin down exactly how a role neuron synchronizes with a symbol
 neuron. I described some ideas for this in Section 2.5, but left the specifics as
 an open question. Basically the role neuron and a corresponding symbol neu
ron fire together, though questions remain about exactly what synchronization
 conditions they satisfy. Another issue is how the system produces this synchro
nized firing. This may require that the graph contain directed edges in both
 directions, between the role neuron and all the possible symbol neurons in the
 SKS that might potentially fill this role. These edges can contribute potential
 between the two neurons so that once they are both firing, each can help the
 other to continue firing.
 In the rest of this section, I elaborate on some issues involved in answering the
 queries. Section 4.1 describes the core of the implementation: a mechanism for
 incrementing the count by 1 while moving one step in the sequence of symbols.
 Section 4.2 describes how to start and end the counting process. Section 4.3
 discusses how to tie it all together to answer the queries.
 Note: We have a small confusion in terminology here. So far, I have been
 referring to the elements in the memorized sequence as “symbols”. But symbols
 are really a broader classification, including, for example, natural numbers. In
 this section, I will be dealing with natural numbers as well as elements of the
 memorized sequence, and I will need to distinguish the two. So for the rest of
 this section, I will use the word “symbols” generically, to indicate any kind of
 symbol, “numbers” for natural numbers, and “letters” for the symbols in the
 memorized sequence (as in the Greek alphabet example). I will rename the
 current-symbol neuron to be the current-letter neuron.
 4.1 Incrementing the count
 I begin with a sketch of a mechanism for incrementing the count by one. Here
 I use the notation rep(si) for the neuron for the ith letter (as I defined earlier),
 and also use rep(i) for the neuron for number i.
 Consider any fixed i ∈ {1,...,k − 1}. The increment operation starts with
 the current-number neuron in the Working Memory bound to neuron rep(i),
 and the current-letter neuron in the Working Memory bound to neuron rep(si).
 Specifically, we start with the current-number and current-letter neurons firing,
 along with the symbol neurons rep(i) and rep(si). The result should be that the
 19
current-number neuron gets bound to rep(i+1), and the current-letter neuron
 gets bound to rep(si+1). That is, we should end with the current-number and
 current-letter neurons firing, along with the symbol neurons rep(i + 1) and
 rep(si+1).
 We assume that the increment is triggered by some special next input signal,
 produced by the firing of a special input neuron.
 Incrementing numbers only: First, I ignore the letters and focus just on
 incrementing the numerical count. I start with a static description of the neu
rons and connections. We have a single current-number neuron in the Working
 Memory and a sequence of number neurons in the SKS. All are modeled as
 threshold gates. The number neurons have threshold given by a parameter h;
 the threshold for the current-number neuron is 0.
 The current-number neuron has directed edges to all the number neurons,
 each having weight c. Each number neuron has a directed edge to the next
 higher number neuron, with weight s. Each number neuron also has a self-loop,
 with weight l.
 In addition, we will have some incoming edges that provide external control
 of parts of the computation. Specifically, we have incoming edges to all the
 number neurons from a single external excitatory source, with weight exc, and
 likewise incoming edges to the number neurons from an external inhibitory
 source, with weight inh. More formally, we define the following parameters:
 • h, the threshold for each number neuron.
 • cur, the weight on the edge from the current-number neuron to each num
ber neuron.
 • l, the weight on the self-loop for each number neuron.
 • s, the weight on the edge from each number neuron to its successor number
 neuron.
 • s′, a value somewhat less than s.
 • exc, the incoming weight on the edges from an external excitatory source
 to all the number neurons.
 • inh, the incoming (negative) weight on the edges from an external in
hibitory neuron to all the number neurons.
 We require that the parameters satisfy the following inequalities:
 1. h ≤cur+l
 2. h >s+cur
 3. h ≤exc+s+cur
 4. h >exc+cur
 20
5. h >cur+l+inh
 6. h ≤cur+l+inh+s′
 Many values satisfy all of these inequalities, such as: cur = 0, l = 4, h = 3,
 s =2, exc =2, inh = −2, s′ = 1.
 Now, how does this mechanism operate? At time 0, the current-number
 neuron and number neuron rep(i) are both firing. The subsequent behavior is
 completely determined by the structure of the network, the initial settings, and
 the arrival of external inputs. (There is no stochasticity here, since the involved
 neurons are all deterministic threshold elements.) The mechanism is triggered
 to start the increment process by the arrival of an excitatory input from an
 external source at all the number nodes. This is supposed to start the firing of
 number neuron rep(i+1). After a small delay, an inhibitory input arrives at all
 the number nodes. This is supposed to stop the firing of number neuron rep(i).
 Here, informally, are the main requirements on the mechanism’s behavior:
 • If the current-number neuron and number neuron rep(i), are firing, they
 continue firing without any external input. If rep(i) is firing, it doesn’t
 trigger number neuron rep(i+1) to fire in the absence of any other inputs
 to rep(i + 1).
 • If an external excitatory input arrives at all the number neurons while
 number neuron rep(i) is firing, the next number neuron, rep(i+1), starts
 f
 iring, while rep(i) continues firing. No other number neurons start firing.
 • If both rep(i) and rep(i + 1) are firing, and an inhibitory input arrives
 at all the number neurons, then rep(i) stops firing, while rep(i +1) keeps
 f
 iring.
 These considerations motivate the inequalities on the parameters, as follows.
 Inequality 1 says that h ≤ cur +l. This says that the incoming potential from
 the current-number neuron, plus the incoming potential from the self-loop on
 number neuron rep(i), are enough to exceed rep(i)’s firing threshold. That
 means that rep(i) continues firing without any external input.
 Inequality 2 says that h > s + cur. This says that incoming potential from
 number neuron rep(i), plus the incoming potential from the current-number
 neuron, are not enough, on their own, to trigger firing of rep(i + 1).
 Inequality 3 says that h ≤ exc+s+cur. This says that, when the incoming
 potential to number neuron rep(i + 1) from rep(i), and the incoming poten
tial from the current-number neuron, are augmented by an external excitatory
 signal, the combination is enough to exceed rep(i + 1)’s firing threshold, and
 thereby trigger it to fire.
 Inequality 4 says that h > ext+cur. This says that incoming potential from
 the external signal, when added to that from the current-number neuron, is not
 enough to cause any other number neuron besides rep(i + 1) to start firing.
 So far, we have arguedthe first twobullets above, which describe hownumber
 neuron rep(i + 1) starts firing. The third bullet deals with stopping the firing
 21
of rep(i). First, Inequality 5 says that h > cur + l + inh. This means that
 the incoming (negative) potential from an inhibitory source, when added to the
 potential from the current-number neuron and the self-loop, is not enough to
 reach the threshold for rep(i). So this will have the effect of stopping the firing
 of rep(i).
 But now we must be careful, because we don’t want the inhibition to also
 stop the firing of rep(i+1). When rep(i) neuron stops firing, its contribution of
 potential to rep(i+1) ceases. So that leaves only potential cur from the current
number neuron, plus l from rep(i + 1)’s self-loop, reduced by the inhibition
 amount inh. Inequality 1 tells us that h ≤ cur +l, but we don’t have anything
 to tell us that h ≤ cur +l +inh, which is what we need here.
 One way out is to extend the model of [8] by allowing the neurons to remem
ber some history of incoming potential. We have extended the model in this way
 before [14]. Essentially, we want to allow the potential contribution from rep(i)
 to degrade over a short period of time (for the time during which the inhibitory
 input persists), rather than disappear immediately. We could capture this by
 assuming that some residual potential contribution of magnitude s′ < s persists
 for at least as long as the interval when the inhibition is being applied. Then
 Inequality 6, which says that h ≤ cur +l +inh+s′, will tell us that rep(i +1)
 has enough incoming potential to keep firing during the inhibition interval. This
 seems rather delicate, but not necessarily unrealistic.
 Incrementing numbers and letters: How can we augment the mechanism
 just defined to increment both the number and the corresponding letter? Well,
 it seems that the same mechanism can work for both sequences, sequentially
 or in parallel. For a parallel solution, we can send the same excitatory and
 inhibitory signals to both the number neurons and the letter neurons. There
 should be no interaction between the two parts. A sequential solution would
 involve separate excitatory and inhibitory signals for the two types of neurons,
 with alternating applications of the signals for the numbers and the letters.
 4.2 Starting and stopping the count
 Next, I consider how to start and stop the count. Consider Query 1.
 Starting: We need a way of triggering the firing of the first number neuron,
 rep(1), and the first letter neuron, rep(s1). Since these neurons have no in
coming potential from predecessor neurons, we will use some special input to
 get them firing. Namely, we assume an external excitatory neuron, with edges
 to both the current-number and current-letter neurons, with sufficiently high
 weight to meet their thresholds. The external neuron also has edges to the
 number neuron rep(1) and the letter neuron rep(s1). These latter two edges
 have weight s + exc instead of just exc as in the incremental mechanism. The
 extra s compensates for the fact that neurons rep(1) and rep(s1) don’t receive
 potential contributions of s from their predecessors.
 22
We also must set the goal to a particular desired goal number g. For this,
 we use another external input to excite the goal neuron to begin firing. And,
 we input the goal number g in unary, and thereby trigger the number neuron
 rep(g) to fire.
 But now we have a danger of confusion involving the number neurons.
 Namely, after these initializations, both the current-number and goal Working
 Memory neurons are firing, together with their corresponding number neurons.
 So there is a danger of confusion between the goal number and the current num
ber. We need a way to disambiguate this. As noted in Section 2.5, this probably
 involves a synchronization protocol, such as alternating the firing activities for
 the two Working Memory neurons.
 Stopping: The mechanism must also recognize when the current count has
 reached the goal number g. This requires an equality-detection mechanism to
 recognize that the goal and current-number Working Memory neurons are bound
 to the same number neuron. The design of such a mechanism would depend
 on how we are resolving the ambiguity in the bindings. For example, if we are
 simply alternating the firings of the two pairs of neurons, then the mechanism
 would have to recognize when the same number neuron fired at consecutive
 times. This might be implemented by maintaining some firing history in the
 state of each number neuron, or in special neurons as in [5].
 When the count is finished, we might also want to stop the firing of the
 current-number neuron. For this, we should use some inhibitory input. This
 remains to be worked out.
 For Query 2, starting the count is slightly different, in that an external input
 is used to trigger the firing of the starting letter neuron. Starting the current
number neuron, and ending the count, are as before. Stopping is as before.
 4.3 Answering the queries
 The complete solution to Query 1 involves advancing through the number
 and letter sequences in parallel, until the equality mechanism detects that the
 current-number neuron and the goal neuron bind to the same number neuron.
 At that point, computational activity shifts to the IKS: another external
 excitatory input signal gets sent to all the intuitive concept neurons in the IKS
 that correspond to letter neurons in the SKS. The unique currently-firing letter
 neuron in the SKS also contributes potential to its corresponding intuitive con
cept neuron in the IKS. Based on a combination of these two types of potential,
 the correct intuitive concept neuron for the chosen letter starts firing.
 Once the correct intuitive concept neuron starts firing, it causes a cascade of
 f
 irings in the IKS, which yields a probability distribution of decision neurons, or
 emotional reaction neurons, that are reached by the cascade. Under plausible
 assumptions about the IKS, with high probability, this soon leads (within some
 time tiks) to a unique, persistent decision. Analyzing this probability will require
 23
a more detailed model of how the firing cascades operate in the IKS.
 The overall latency for answering the query will be approximately gd+tiks,
 for some constant d, where we are allowing d steps to account for each increment
 of current-number.
 Processing for Query 2 is similar, and we leave that to the reader. The
 difference is in the initialization of current-number.
 5 Parse Trees
 The second example of a symbolic knowledge structure is a parse tree for a
 sentence. A parse tree, as studied in linguistics, consists of nonterminals at the
 internal nodes of a tree and terminals at the leaves. Parse trees are generally
 constructed based on context-free grammar rules. Since these rules are recursive,
 this allows for the construction of arbitrarily large and complex parse trees.
 However, sentences that are normally encountered in practice are not very large
 or complex, so their parse trees are rather small.
 In this paper, I consider a variant of the usual parse trees, in which the
 children of every node in the tree are unordered. For example, a sentence may
 consist of a subject noun, predicate verb, and object noun, but the order of these
 three elements is not significant. In different languages, these three elements
 might be presented, orally or in writing, in different orders—say, (subject, pred
icate, object) vs. (subject, object, predicate). But in the SKS representation,
 it is enough to remember just that the sentence consists of these three parts.
 Unlike the sequences in Sections 3 and 4, I do not assume that the parse trees
 are memorized in the SKS ahead of time. Rather, the words of a sentence are
 presented as input (by hearing or reading), and the parse tree gets constructed
 on-the-fly. However, I think it is very likely that the general structure of typical
 parse trees is built into the brain a priori, as a result of evolution or early learn
ing. For example, for 3-word sentences that consist of just a subject, predicate,
 and object, there is probably a built-in structure in the SKS that represents this
 general parse tree structure. The particular nouns and verb that appear in a
 particular sentence are, of course, not built in, but are filled in during processing
 of the sentence. For more complex sentences, more work will be needed during
 sentence processing to determine the structure of the tree, as well as for filling
 in the words.
 In any case, during sentence processing, an (unordered) parse tree gets con
structed in the SKS. Some simplified representation of this tree then gets passed
 to the IKS, which associates intuitive meaning with the sentence via cascades of
 f
 iring, producing as output a kind of “story”. Here I am drastically simplifying
 matters, by neglecting the possibility that the IKS helps in constructing the
 parse tree. This sort of semantic disambiguation is common in language under
standing, but I will restrict attention for now to sentences that can be parsed
 based just on their syntax.
 24
Example: 3-word sentences: As a special case, I will sometimes consider
 parse trees with a very simple structure corresponding to 3-word sentences con
sisting of a subject noun, predicate verb, and object noun.
 In terms of traditional context-free grammars, the nonterminals are Sen
tence, Subject, Predicate, Object, Noun, and TransitiveVerb, with Sentence as
 the starting nonterminal. The set of terminals is a large collection of already
memorized nouns and transitive verbs. The formal grammar productions are:
 • Sentence ⇒ Subject Predicate Object9.
 • Subject ⇒ Noun, Predicate ⇒ TransitiveVerb, Object ⇒ Noun.
 • Noun ⇒ boy, baby, horse, ball, banana, tablecloth,...; Verb ⇒ kicks, eats,
 sews,...
 In this special case, verbs are always present tense. Example sentences include
 “Boykicks ball.”, “Baby eats banana.”, “Horse sews tablecloth.”, etc. Assuming
 this general parse tree structure is built into the SKS a priori, what remains to
 be done during parsing is just filling in the terminals.
 For more general cases, I will consider more complicated sentences and parse
 trees, and also cases where the sentence structure is not known a priori, but must
 be determined during sentence processing. In this latter case, additional work
 will be involved in determining the parse tree structure, in addition to the work
 of filling in the terminals.
 Some details appear in the next two subsections. But this is all quite pre
liminary, and there is much more to be done.
 5.1 Representation and computation in the SKS
 Here I describe how parse trees might be represented in the SKS, how the parsing
 process might work, and what output is produced.
 Parse tree representation: A parse tree could be represented in the SKS
 fairly directly, with a neuron representing each node of the tree and edges con
necting the neurons that represent parents and children in the tree. Note that
 this neural network representation does not specify any ordering for the chil
dren of a node, which is fine since we are considering unordered versions of parse
 trees. The terminal and nonterminal symbols are also represented by neurons
 in the Lexicon; for each such symbol that occurs in a parse tree, there are edges
 back and forth between the Lexicon entry and the neurons in the parse tree that
 are labeled by that symbol.
 The parse tree for an input sentence can be constructed in the SKS by
 allocating neurons for the nodes in the parse tree and establishing the needed
 9But recall that the order of the three elements is not significant. We should more properly
 regard the right-hand side of this production as a set consisting of these three nonterminals.
 This simplification will probably affect the representations and their processing costs.
 25
connections. This may seem like a time-consuming learning process, which
 is inconsistent with the speed with which humans recognize basic sentences.
 However, the process can be sped up if the high-level portions of the tree are
 already represented in the SKS, as a result of evolution or previous learning.
 This captures the idea that the brain starts the parsing process already having
 built-in familiarity with standard sentence structures. I think this is reasonable,
 and I will assume it from now on.
 In fact, to make things as simple as possible, I will assume here that the SKS
 maintains a collection of standard sentence structures, each with a complete
 parse tree shape and all of its nonterminals filled in. Moreover, every sentence
 that is input will fit one of these standard structures. So the only things that
 need to be filled in are the terminals.10
 The parsing process: Given our strong assumptions, the parsing process
 needs to perform only two tasks: (1) determine which standard structure fits
 the given sentence, and (2) finish the construction of the parse tree by associating
 specific terminals to the leaves.
 Since sentences are input word-by-word, it seems plausible that the SKS
 might start out with a large collection of possible sentence structures, and nar
row down the set of possibilities with each new word, until only one possible
 structure remains. For each new word that is input, the SKS tries to incorpo
rate the word into its proper place in each of its still-possible parse trees. If
 it fails (for example, because the new word is the wrong part of speech for the
 structure), then the SKS drops the structure from its set of possibilities.
 For example, consider two sentence structures: (subject, predicate, object)
 and (subject, predicate). Suppose that an English sentence is being presented,
 and its second word is a verb that can be either transitive or intransitive (such
 as eats, runs, reads, etc.). Then after the first two words arrive, both structures
 are still possible, and the verb can be assigned to a leaf in both of their parse
 trees. After that, either the sentence ends, or another noun arrives. This leads
 to attempts to match both partial parse trees, but only one succeeds.
 It remains to devise a workable SNN-based data structure for keeping track
 of the set of possibilities. This should include: a way of representing multiple
 parse trees in the SKS; a mechanism to incorporate each successive input into
 each possible parse tree, producing an indicator when this is impossible; and a
 mechanism to identify when only one parsetree remains in the set of possibilities.
 During construction of a parse tree, the Working Memory will help in assign
ing terminals to particular leaves of the tree. For example, in a simple (Subject,
 Predicate, Object) sentence, a Working Memory neuron may represent the Sub
ject role, and may bind to a symbol neuron for a particular noun. This binding
 should persist long enough to establish the firing patterns needed to incorporate
 the noun into the SKS representation of the parse tree.11
 10This is definitely an oversimplification of real sentence processing, but I think it is worth
 understanding this case first.
 11The use of Working Memory will be more complicated in more complicated sentences.
 26
Although the internal SKS representations for parse trees are language
independent, the method of assigning terminals to nodes in the parse trees
 is language-specific. For example, consider simple three-word (subject, predi
cate, object) sentences. Recall that the parse trees do not specify an order for
 these three parts of the sentence. But particular languages will have their own
 ordering conventions. For example, in English, the first word in a sentence will
 generally be the Subject, the second the Predicate, and the third the Object.
 Other languages may use different conventions. These language conventions
 lead to different rules for parsing an input sentence. In this way, we can have a
 language-independent internal representation of the sentence structure, with a
 language-specific way of performing the parse.
 This all suggests to me that the internal SKS parse tree representations may
 be built-in, as a result of evolution, whereas particular languages are certainly
 learned. It remains to develop particular learning algorithms by which the brain
 can learn different parsing methods for different languages, all based on the same
 SKS parse tree structures.
 Output of the SKS: In any case, the SKS eventually produces the parse
 tree for an input sentence. Actually, it probably doesn’t retain the entire parse
 tree; for example, the intermediate neurons representing the nonterminals Noun
 and TransitiveVerb are not necessary once parsing is finished. So what the SKS
 produces is a reduced version of the parse tree; for example, for a simple 3-word
 sentence, the reduced version will probably contain some representation of the
 sentence as a whole, of the three parts of the sentence, and of the actual nouns
 and verbs that make up these parts.12
 Arbitrarily complex sentence structures: For standard sentence struc
tures, the representations of the parse trees are compact and fit easily in the
 SKS. Also, the Working Memory is large enough to keep track of the parts of the
 sentence and manage the parsing process. But this is not the case for arbitrarily
 complex sentence structures. In order to construct very large parse trees, the
 parts that don’t fit in the SKS and Working Memory would have to be recorded
 somewhere outside the SKS, perhaps on paper. There is no limit to how much
 can be written on paper!
 Consider the sentence “The boy who eats the candy pets the duck.” The phrase “The boy
 who eats the candy” can be parsed first, with the help of Working Memory neurons. The
 result of this parsing is a branch of a parse tree. But then we want to treat the entire phrase
 as a unit, to be related to the rest of the sentence. So a nonterminal symbol node in the SKS
 that represents this entire phrase can bind to a Working Memory neuron that corresponds
 to the role “Subject”, and the rest of the parse can proceed. In fact, the same neurons in
 Working Memory might be reused in different parts of the parse, e.g., a Subject role neuron
 can bind to a neuron representing the terminal “boy” in parsing the first phrase, and later to
 a neuron representing the subtree for the entire phrase “The boy who eats the candy”.
 12This representation might be a small labeled graph of neurons, containing a neuron for
 the sentence and one for each of its three terminals. Edges between the sentence neuron and
 the terminal neurons could be labeled by their roles—subject, predicate, or object.
 27
5.2 Representation and computation in the IKS
 Now what happens to the (reduced) representation of the parse tree that is
 produced by the SKS? Basically, the firing of the neurons in this representa
tion, possibly with the help of some external signal, should trigger the firing of
 some related intuitive concept neurons in the IKS. Then the IKS firing cascades
 proceed until they result in some output.
 The intuitive concept neurons that are triggered should comprise some type
 of outline for the “story” that the parsed sentence tells.13 This should be a
 collection of neurons that together represent the individual components and the
 relationships between them; the precise structure for this outline remains to be
 determined. In the case of simple 3-word sentences, we might have one concept
 neuron that represents the general idea of a “story” plus neurons representing
 the three concepts that comprise the story, tagged somehow by their roles in the
 story (as in the SKS representation). But there may be more to it: a verb might
 be represented, not by a single concept neuron, but by a collection of neurons
 that fire according to some timing pattern corresponding to the action denoted
 by the verb. “Kicks” would probably be represented by some neurons whose
 f
 iring corresponds to the action of kicking, including its direction and speed.
 Open question 2: Pin down precise reduced representations for parse trees
 in the SKS, and precise representations for outlines for simple stories in the
 IKS. Develop a mechanism by which an SKS representation of a parse tree can
 trigger the corresponding IKS representation of a story outline.
 Once these initial concept neurons are triggered, they start the usual IKS
 cascade of firing, continuing until some IKS output is produced. This cascade
 does not follow just the associations that arise from the individual elements
 of the sentence/story, but also the combinations of the elements and the re
lationships between them. That is, the cascade selects for associations that
 are relevant to the story. For example, in the sentence “Boy kicks ball.”, the
 combination of words is likely to trigger a picture of a boy aged 6-10 running
 outdoors, kicking a soccer-ball-sized ball, rather than a picture of a baby boy
 sitting indoors, or a golf ball on a tee. The sentence “Horse sews tablecloth.”
 is likely to trigger a cartoon of a horse sitting at a table, but is unlikely to
 trigger a picture of a racehorse at a racetrack or an elegant lace tablecloth in a
 dinner setting. The context provided by the other parts of the story and their
 relationships influence the associations that arise from each particular part.
 Such a cascade pattern should arise naturally in a Spiking Neural Network
 model because the neurons representing the various parts of a story all con
tribute potential to other concept neurons. This potential adds up, thereby
 13This may bring to mind Winston’s emphasis on “stories” produced in the brain [16]. How
ever, Winston’s stories are different: they are paragraphs consisting of many short sentences,
 from which a computer program can extract meaning. It is possible that the representations
 used in this computer programs might provide ideas for how simple stories can be represented
 in an IKS model.
 28
encouraging the firing of neurons for concepts that are relevant to the entire
 story, rather than just the individual parts.
 The IKS representation of the story gets refined over a short period of time,
 as a result of the cascade of IKS neuron firings. The IKS representation that
 is triggered directly by the SKS representation, that is, the story outline, is
 probably rudimentary, and gets more detailed over a short time, as more context
 information gets incorporated. All of this is still fast thinking, since the actions
 of the IKS cascade are fast.
 What is the final output that is produced by this IKS process? It should be a
 mental picture of the activity in the story. Such a picture might be represented in
 the IKS using a typical internal form for visual processing in computer vision—
 an abstract two-dimensional picture that has rudimentary representations of the
 key components (stick figures, outlines of buildings, etc.). It can be a kind of
 cartoon. The picture will usually be dynamic, since one of its constituents is a
 verb, indicating an action.
 As we had for the sequence example, we could have a further IKS output
 representing the main judgment or emotion that is triggered by the picture,
 such as “pleasant”, “unpleasant”, or “absurd”.
 Interaction between SKS and IKS: We have been considering only a spe
cial case of sentence understanding in which the SKS performs symbolic pro
cessing first, then passes control to the IKS, which produces a picture of the
 story, and judges whether the story is pleasant, unpleasant, absurd, etc. This
 one-way interaction is similar to what happens in our sequence example. More
 elaborate parsing examples would incorporate feedback from the IKS to the
 SKS, for instance, when semantic information is used to resolve ambiguities in
 the parse structure.
 6 Learning the Representations
 So far, I have described situations in which symbolic knowledge structures have
 already been established. But we should also consider how these structures
 might become established in the first place, by evolution or learning. Some
 structures may be innate, such as a neural structure that is particularly suited
 for learning arbitrary sequences or hierarchical structures, or for recognizing
 certain standard types of sentences. But many other structures must be learned
 from experience. I won’t go into depth here about learning issues, but will
 simply give a high-level overview.
 Here are some general types of things that must be learned. In all cases, we
 can consider the changes at two levels of abstraction, and how they correspond
 at the two levels.
 1. New intuitive concepts: These must get placed somewhere in the IKS.
 New neuron(s) must be selected to represent them. This might involve
 the use of a Winner-Take-All mechanism. Valiant’s book [15] contains
 29
some example protocols based on random graphs. Lynch and Mallmann
Trenn [7] present others based on identifying the candidate neuron with
 the highest incoming potential.
 2. New symbols: These must get placed somewhere in the SKS, and also in
 the Lexicon. The method of choosing new representing neurons can be
 similar to what is used in the IKS. Also, for each new symbol, connections
 must be set up in both directions between the neurons in the Lexicon and
 those in the SKS corresponding to the new symbol.
 3. Connections between intuitive concepts: Since people (and probably other
 animals) can learn to relate any pair of intuitive concepts, the brain must
 have sufficient physical connections between concept neurons to support
 this learning. These connections can be strengthened or weakened as a
 result of experiences.
 Thus, the underlying directed graph in the IKS should also be sufficiently
 connected. Edge weights should increase and decrease in response to expe
riences, according to some version of Hebbian learning. This learning will
 probably be gradual because of the noisy nature of learning of intuitive
 concepts and relationships.
 4. Connections between symbols: Learning a symbolic structure, such as a
 sequence or linguistic structure, is different from learning connections be
tween intuitive concepts. It doesn’t just happen automatically, as a result
 of experience, but requires attention, is more purposeful, and is controlled
 by some outside stimulus. The process should be less noisy than intuitive
 learning.
 Thus, learning in the SKS should also involve attention, in the form of
 Working Memory. The learning rule does not need to accommodate much
 noise, so it can make larger jumps than learning rules in the IKS.
 Because activity in the SKS is more purposeful, learning can proceed
 in more interesting ways than just simple Hebbian rules. For example,
 learning a sequence, such as the Greek alphabet, is not just simple Hebbian
 learning of individual connections between consecutive pairs of symbols.
 Rather, it may be more like learning a song, taking advantage of some
 overall structure, such as a rhythmic pattern.
 For another example, consider the problem of learning a language, specifi
cally, the sub-problem of learning the language’s conventions for the order
 of words in a sentence, as described in Section 5.1. In terms of an SNN
 model, this means learning a network that will handle sentence inputs
 correctly for the given language, assigning the successive words to the ap
propriate positions in a built-in parse tree. This network might be learned
 through a supervised learning process, where wrong attempts lead to non
sense sentences and give negative feedback.
 30
5. Connections between symbols and their intuitive counterparts: Intuitive
 concepts may be learned simultaneously with their symbols, or in either
 order. In any case, a new symbol is learned (in the SKS and Lexicon),
 and a new concept is learned (in the IKS). Repeated simultaneous presen
tation of the symbol and the concept can lead, via Hebbian learning, to
 strengthening of weights on the edges connecting them. Another matter
 that remains to be considered is how connections can be learned between
 complex symbolic structures and corresponding complex intuitive struc
tures.
 In all of these cases, it would be good to describe and analyze specific learning
 mechanisms. These could be evaluated in terms of speed of learning.
 7 Conclusions
 In this paper, I have proposed that two distinct types of structures are present
 in the brain: Symbolic Knowledge Structures (SKSs), used for formal symbolic
 reasoning, and Intuitive Knowledge Structures (IKSs), used for drawing infor
mal associations. I have described many ideas for modeling these structures,
 and for implementing them in Spiking Neural Networks. I have developed two
 basic examples of their use: counting through a memorized sequence of disease
 variants, and understanding simple sentences with predetermined structure.
 I repeat my disclaimer from the beginning of the paper, that this is a collec
tion of ideas for a theory, but not a complete, coherent theory. I am interested
 in developing this further, until the whole thing makes sense in terms of a for
mal model like that in [8]. The approach should be algorithmic, like that used
 in [9, 7], with formal network descriptions and analysis. But that will take
 considerably more thought and work.
 Much more remains to be done in pinning down the various individual mech
anisms, and expressing them in terms of a single Spiking Neural Network model.
 In particular, for the Working Memory attention mechanism, we need more de
tails for how the binding between Working Memory neurons and SKS neurons
 works, especially for how firing is synchronized (Open question 1). For the pars
ing example, we need more details of how a parse tree gets filled in, and how
 it gets copied from the SKS to the IKS in the form of a story outline (Open
 question 2).
 Many more examples of symbolic reasoning can be considered, including
 more interesting arithmetic calculations than just counting, and more elaborate
 linguistic examples than parsing of sentences with simple, predictable structure.
 Higher mathematical reasoning such as solving algebraic equations, and even
 creative construction of mathematical proofs, are also interesting to consider.
 We can also study examples involving elaborate interactions between SKS and
 IKS, rather than just simple one-way interactions as in the examples in this
 paper.
 So, there is still very much to be done. I hope that this preliminary paper
 31
might elicit some suggestions, and interest some other researchers in pursuing
 these ideas.

 Abstract
 Deep neural learning uses an increasing amount of computation and data to solve
 very specific problems. By stark contrast, human minds solve a wide range of
 problems using a fixed amount of computation and limited experience. One ability
 that seems crucial to this kind of general intelligence is meta-reasoning, i.e., our
 ability to reason about reasoning. To make deep learning do more from less, we
 propose the first neural meta-symbolic system (NEMESYS) for reasoning and
 learning: meta programming using differentiable forward-chaining reasoning in
 f
 irst-order logic. Differentiable meta programming naturally allows NEMESYS to
 reason and learn several tasks efficiently. This is different from performing object
level deep reasoning and learning, which refers in some way to entities external
 to the system. In contrast, NEMESYS enables self-introspection, lifting from
 object- to meta-level reasoning and vice versa. In our extensive experiments, we
 demonstrate that NEMESYS can solve different kinds of tasks by adapting the
 meta-level programs without modifying the internal reasoning system. Moreover,
 we show that NEMESYS can learn meta-level programs given examples. This is
 difficult, if not impossible, for standard differentiable logic programming.

 1 Introduction
 One of the distant goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to build a fully autonomous or
 ‘human-like’ system. The current successes of deep learning systems such as DALLE
2 [1], ChatGPT [2, 3], and Gato [4] have been promoted as bringing the field closer to
 this goal. However, current systems still require a large number of computations and
 often solve rather specific tasks. For example, DALLE-2 can generate very high-quality
 images but cannot play chess or Atari games. In stark contrast, human minds solve a
 wide range of problems using a small amount of computation and limited experience.
 Most importantly, to be considered a major step towards achieving Artificial Gen
eral Intelligence (AGI), a system must not only be able to perform a variety of tasks,
 such as Gato [4] playing Atari games, captioning images, chatting, and controlling a
 real robot arm, but also be self-reflective and able to learn and reason about its own
 capabilities. This means that it must be able to improve itself and adapt to new situa
tions through self-reflection [5–8]. Consequently, the study of meta-level architectures
 such as meta learning [9] and meta-reasoning [7] becomes progressively important.
 Meta learning [10] is a way to improve the learning algorithm itself [11, 12], i.e., it
 performs learning at a higher level, or meta-level. Meta-reasoning is a related concept
 that involves a system being able to think about its own abilities and how it processes
 information [5, 6]. It involves reflecting on, or introspecting about, the system’s own
 reasoning processes.

 Table 1 Comparisons between NEMESYS and other state-of-the-art Neuro-Symbolic
 systems. We compare these systems with NEMESYS in three aspects, whether the system
 performs meta reasoning, can the same system adapt to solve different tasks and is the
 system capable of differentiable meta level structure learning.
 Indeed, meta-reasoning is different from object-centric reasoning, which refers to
 the system thinking about entities external to itself [13–15]. Here, the models per
form low-level visual perception and reasoning on high-level concepts. Accordingly,
 there has been a push to make these reasoning systems differentiable [16, 17] along
 with addressing benchmarks in a visual domain such as CLEVR [18] and Kandinsky
 patterns [19, 20]. They use object-centric neural networks to perceive objects and per
form reasoning using their output. Although this can solve the proposed benchmarks
 to some extent, the critical question remains unanswered: Is the reasoner able to jus
tify its own operations? Can the same model solve different tasks such as (causal)
 reasoning, planning, game playing, and much more?
 To overcome these limitations, we propose NEMESYS, the first neural meta
symbolic reasoning system. NEMESYS extensively performs meta-level programming
 on neuro-symbolic systems, and thus it can reason and learn several tasks. This is dif
ferent from performing object-level deep reasoning and learning, which refers in some
 way to entities external to the system. NEMESYS is able to reflect or introspect,
 i.e., to shift from object- to meta-level reasoning and vice versa.
 Overall, we make the following contributions:
 1. We propose NEMESYS, the first neural meta-symbolic reasoning and learning
 system that performs differentiable forward reasoning using meta-level programs.
 2. To evaluate the ability of NEMESYS, we propose a challenging task, visual concept
 repairing, where the task is to rearrange objects in visual scenes based on relational
 logical concepts.
 3. We empirically show that NEMESYS can efficiently solve different visual reasoning
 tasks with meta-level programs, achieving comparable performances with object
level forward reasoners [16, 24] that use specific programs for each task.
 4. Moreover, we empirically show that using powerful differentiable meta-level pro
gramming, NEMESYS can solve different kinds of tasks that are difficult, if
 not impossible, for the previous neuro-symbolic systems. In our experiments,
 NEMESYS provides the function of (i) reasoning with integrated proof generation,
 i.e., performing differentiable reasoning producing proof trees, (ii) explainable arti
f
 icial intelligence (XAI), i.e., highlighting the importance of logical atoms given
 3
conclusions, (iii) reasoning avoiding infinite loops, i.e., performing differentiable
 reasoning on programs which cause infinite loops that the previous logic reasoning
 systems unable to solve, and (iv) differentiable causal reasoning, i.e., performing
 causal reasoning [27, 28] on a causal Bayesian network using differentiable meta
 reasoners. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, we propose the first differentiable
 do operator. Achieving these functions with object-level reasoners necessitates sig
nificant efforts, and in some cases, it may be unattainable. In stark contrast,
 NEMESYS successfully realized the different useful functions by having different
 meta-level programs without any modifications of the reasoning function itself.
 5. We demonstrate that NEMESYS can perform structure learning on the meta-level,
 i.e., learning meta programs from examples and adapting itself to solve different
 tasks automatically by learning efficiently with gradients.
 To this end, we will proceed as follows. We first review (differentiable) first-order
 logic and reasoning. We then derive NEMESYS by introducing differentiable logical
 meta programming. Before concluding, we illustrate several capabilities of NEMESYS.
 2 Background
 NEMESYS relies on several research areas: first-order logic, logic programming,
 differentiable reasoning, meta-reasoning and-learning.
 First-Order Logic (FOL)/Logic Programming. A term is a constant, a vari
able, or a term which consists of a function symbol. We denote n-ary predicate p by
 p/(n,[dt1,...,dtn]), where dti is the datatype of i-th argument. An atom is a formula
 p(t1,...,tn), where p is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1,...,tn are terms. A ground
 atom or simply a fact is an atom with no variables. A literal is an atom or its negation.
 A positive literal is an atom. A negative literal is the negation of an atom. A clause
 is a finite disjunction (∨) of literals. A ground clause is a clause with no variables. A
 definite clause is a clause with exactly one positive literal. If A,B1,...,Bn are atoms,
 then A∨¬B1∨...∨¬Bn is a definite clause. We write definite clauses in the form of
 A :- B1,...,Bn. Atom A is called the head, and a set of negative atoms {B1,...,Bn}
 is called the body. We call definite clauses as clauses for simplicity in this paper.
 Differentiable Forward-Chaining Reasoning. The forward-chaining inference
 is a type of inference in first-order logic to compute logical entailment [29]. The dif
ferentiable forward-chaining inference [16, 17] computes the logical entailment in a
 differentiable manner using tensor-based operations. Many extensions of differentiable
 forward reasoners have been developed, e.g., reinforcement learning agents using logic
 to compute the policy function [30, 31] and differentiable rule learners in complex
 visual scenes [24]. NEMESYS performs differentiable meta-level logic programming
 based on differentiable forward reasoners.
 Meta Reasoning and Learning. Meta-reasoning is the study about systems
 which are able to reason about its operation, i.e., a system capable of meta-reasoning
 may be able to reflect, or introspect [32], shifting from meta-reasoning to object
level reasoning and vice versa [6, 7]. Compared with imperative programming, it is
 relatively easier to construct a meta-interpreter using declarative programming. First
order Logic [33] has been the major tool to realize the meta-reasoning systems [34–36].

level reasoning pipeline. Using the meta program (bottom right) it can realize the standard Prolog
 engine (naive interpreter) or an interpreter that provides e.g., also the proof trees (interpreter with
 proof trees) without requiring any alterations to the original logic program and internal reasoning
 function. This means that NEMESYS can integrate many useful functionalities by simply changing
 devised meta programs without intervening the internal reasoning function. (Best viewed in color)
 For example, Prolog [37] provides very efficient implementations of meta-interpreters
 realizing different additional features to the language.
 Despite early interest in meta-reasoning within classical Inductive Logic Pro
gramming (ILP) systems [38–40], meta-interpreters have remained unexplored within
 neuro-symbolic AI. Meta-interpreters within classical logic are difficult to be com
bined with gradient-based machine learning paradigms, e.g., deep neural networks.
 NEMESYS realizes meta-level reasoning using differentiable forward reasoners in
 f
 irst-order logic, which are able to perform differentiable rule learning on complex
 visual scenes with deep neural networks [24]. Moreover, NEMESYS paves the way
 to integrate meta-level reasoning into other neuro-symbolic frameworks, including
 DeepProbLog [21], Scallop [25] and NeurASP [26], which are rather developed for
 training neural networks given logic programs using differentiable backward reasoning
 or answer set semantics. We compare NEMESYS with several popular neuro-symbolic
 systems in three aspects: whether the system performs meta reasoning, can the same
 system adapt to solve different tasks and is the system capable of differentiable
 meta level structure learning. The comparison results are summarized in Table 1.
 3 Neural Meta-Symbolic Reasoning & Learning
 We now introduce NEMESYS, the first neural meta-symbolic reasoning and learning
 framework. Fig. 2 shows an overview of NEMESYS.
 5
3.1 Meta Logic Programming
 We describe how meta-level programs are used in the NEMESYS workflow. In Fig. 2,
 the following object-level clause is given as its input:
 same
 shape
 pair(X,Y):-shape(X,Z),shape(Y,Z).
 which identifies pairs of objects that have the same shape. The clause is subse
quently fed to Meta Converter, which generates meta-level atoms.Using meta predicate
 clause/2, the following atom is generated:
 clause(same
 shape
 pair(X,Y),(shape(X,Z),shape(Y,Z))).
 where the meta atom clause(H,B) represents the object-level clause: H:-B.
 To perform meta-level reasoning, NEMESYS uses meta-level programs, which often
 refer to meta interpreters, i.e., interpreters written in the language itself, as illustrated
 in Fig. 2. For example, a naive interpreter, NaiveInterpreter, is defined as:
 solve(true).
 solve((A,B)):-solve(A),solve(B).
 solve(A):-clause(A,B),solve(B).
 To solve a compound goal (A,B), we need first solve A and then B. A single goal A is
 solved if there is a clause that rewrites the goal to the new goal B, the body of the
 clause: A:-B. This process stops for facts, encoded as clause(fact,true), since then,
 solve(true) will be true.
 NEMESYScanemploy more enriched meta programs with useful functions by sim
ply changing the meta programs, without modifying the internal reasoning function,
 as illustrated in the bottom right of Fig. 2. ProofTreeInterpreter, an interpreter
 that produces proof trees along with reasoning, is defined as:
 solve(A,(A:-true)).
 solve((A,B),(proofA,proofB)):-solve(A,proofA),solve(B,proofB).
 solve(A,(A:-proofB)):-clause(A,B),solve(B,proofB).
 where solve(A,Proof) checks if atom A is true with proof tree Proof. Using this meta
program, NEMESYS can perform reasoning with integrated proof tree generation.
 Now, let us devise the differentiable meta-level reasoning pipeline, which enables
 NEMESYS to reason and learn flexibly.
 3.2 Differentiable Meta Programming
 NEMESYS employs differentiable forward reasoning [24], which computes logical
 entailment using tensor operations in a differentiable manner, by adapting it to the
 meta-level atoms and clauses.
 6
We define a meta-level reasoning function freason
 (C,W) : [0,1]G → [0,1]G parameterized
 by meta-rules C and their weights W. We denote the set of meta-rules by C, and the
 set of all of the meta-ground atoms by G. G contains all of the meta-ground atoms
 produced by a given FOL language. We consider ordered sets here, i.e., each element
 has its index. We denote the size of the sets as: G = |G| and C = |C|. We denote the
 i-th element of vector x by x[i], and the (i,j)-th element of matrix X by X[i,j].
 First, NEMESYS converts visual input to a valuation vector v ∈ [0,1]G, which
 maps each meta atom to a probabilistic value (Fig. 2 Meta Converter). For example,
 v =
 0.98 solve(color(obj1, cyan))
 0.01 solve(color(obj1, red))
 0.95 clause(same
 shape
 pair(...), (shape(...), ...))
 represents a valuation vector that maps each meta-ground atom to a probabilistic
 value. For readability, only selected atoms are shown. NEMESYS computes logical
 entailment by updating the initial valuation vector v(0) for T times to v(T).
 Subsequently, we compose the reasoning function that computes logical entailment.
 We now describe each step in detail.
 (Step 1) Encode Logic Programs to Tensors.
 To achieve differentiable forward reasoning, each meta-rule is encoded to a tensor
 representation. Let S be the maximum number of substitutions for existentially quan
tified variables in C, and L be the maximum length of the body of rules in C. Each
 meta-rule Ci ∈ C is encoded to a tensor Ii ∈ NG× S× L, which contains the indices of
 body atoms. Intuitively, Ii[j,k,l] is the index of the l-th fact (subgoal) in the body of
 the i-th rule to derive the j-th fact with the k-th substitution for existentially quan
tified variables. We obtain Ii by firstly grounding the meta rule Ci, then computing
 the indices of the ground body atoms, and transforming them into a tensor.
 (Step 2) Assign Meta-Rule Weights.
 Weassign weights to compose the reasoning function with several meta-rules as follows:
 (i) We fix the target programs’ size as M, i.e., we try to select a meta-program
 with M meta-rules out of C candidate meta rules. (ii) We introduce C-dimensional
 weights W = [w1,...,wM] where wi ∈ RC. (iii) We take the softmax of each weight
 vector wj ∈ W and softly choose M meta rules out of C meta rules to compose the
 differentiable meta program.
 (Step 3) Perform Differentiable Inference.
 We compute 1-step forward reasoning using weighted meta-rules, then we recursively
 perform reasoning to compute T-step reasoning.
 (i) Reasoning using one rule. First, for each meta-rule Ci ∈ C, we evaluate
 body atoms for different grounding of Ci by computing:
 b(t)
 i,j,k =
 gather(v(t),Ii)[j,k,l],
 1≤l≤L
 7
 (1)
where gather : [0,1]G ×NG×S×L → [0,1]G×S×L is:
 gather(x,Y)[j,k,l] = x[Y[j,k,l]],
 and b(t)
 (2)
 i,j,k ∈ [0,1]. The gather function replaces the indices of the body atoms by the
 current valuation values in v(t). To take logical and across the subgoals in the body,
 we take the product across valuations. b(t)
 i,j,k represents the valuation of body atoms
 for i-th meta-rule using k-th substitution for the existentially quantified variables to
 deduce j-th meta-ground atom at time t.
 Now we take logical or softly to combine all of the different grounding for Ci by
 computing c(t)
 i,j ∈ [0,1]:
 c(t)
 i,j = softorγ(b(t)
 i,j,1, . . . , b(t)
 where softorγ is a smooth logical or function:
 softorγ(x1,...,xn) = γ log 
i,j,S),
 exp(xi/γ),
 1≤i≤n
 (3)
 (4)
 where γ > 0 is a smooth parameter. Eq. 4 is an approximation of the max function
 over probabilistic values based on the log-sum-exp approach [41].
 (ii) Combine results from different rules. Now we apply different meta-rules
 using the assigned weights by computing:
 h(t)
 j,m =
 where h(t)
 w∗
 m,i · c(t)
 i,j ,
 1≤i≤C
 (5)
 j,m ∈ [0,1], w∗
 m,i = exp(wm,i)/ i′ 
exp(wm,i′), and wm,i = wm[i]. Note that
 w∗
 m,i is interpreted as a probability that meta-rule Ci ∈ C is the m-th component. We
 complete the 1-step forward reasoning by combining the results from different weights:
 r(t)
 j =softorγ(h(t)
 j,1, . . . , h(t)
 j,M).
 (6)
 Taking softorγ means that we compose M softly chosen rules out of C candidate
 meta-rules.
 (iii) Multi-step reasoning. We perform T-step forward reasoning by computing
 r(t)
 j
 recursively for T times: v(t+1)
 j
 =softorγ(r(t)
 j ,v(t)
 j ). Updating the valuation vector
 for T-times corresponds to computing logical entailment softly by T-step forward rea
soning. The whole reasoning computation Eq. 1-6 can be implemented using efficient
 tensor operations.

 With the methodology of NEMESYS established, we subsequently provide empir
ical evidence of its benefits over neural baselines and object-level neuro-symbolic

 baselines are shown in [15].
 approaches: (1) NEMESYS can emulate a differentiable forward reasoner, i.e., it is
 a sufficient implementation of object-centric reasoners with a naive meta program.
 (2) NEMESYS is capable of differentiable meta-level reasoning, i.e., it can integrate
 additional useful functions using devised meta-rules. We demonstrate this advantage
 by solving tasks of proof-tree generation, relevance propagation, automated planning,
 and causal reasoning. (3) NEMESYS can perform parameter and structure learning
 efficiently using gradient descent, i.e., it can perform learning on meta-level programs.
 In our experiments, we implemented NEMESYS in Python using PyTorch, with
 CPU: intel i7-10750H and RAM: 16 GB.
 4.1 Visual Reasoning on Complex Pattenrs
 Let us start off by showing that our NEMESYS is able to obtain the equivalent
 high-quality results as a standard object-level reasoner but on the meta-level. We con
sidered tasks of Kandinsky patterns [19, 43] and CLEVR-Hans [14]1. CLEVR-Hans is
 a classification task of complex 3D visual scenes. We compared NEMESYS with the
 naive interpreter against neural baselines and a neuro-symbolic baseline, αILP [24],
 which achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks. For all tasks, NEMESYS
 achieved exactly the same performances with αILP since the naive interpreter realizes
 a conventional object-centric reasoner. Moreover, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3,
 NEMESYS outperformed neural baselines on each task. This shows that NEMESYS
 is able to solve complex visual reasoning tasks using meta-level reasoning without
 sacrificing performance.
 In contrast to the object-centric reasoners, e.g., αILP. NEMESYS can easily inte
grate additional useful functions by simply switching or adding meta programs without
 modifying the internal reasoning function, as shown in the next experiments.
 4.2 Explainable Logical Reasoning
 One of the major limitations of differentiable forward chaining [16, 17, 24] is that
 they lack the ability to explain the reasoning steps and their evidence. We show
 1We refer to [14] and [15] for detailed explanations of the used patterns for CLEVR-Hans and Kandinsky
 patterns.

 Fig. 3 NEMESYS explains its reasoning with proof trees and relevance proof propaga
tion. Given the image involving four objects (top, right), NEMESYS provides two proofs (two boxes
 on the left, true atom’s proof (blue box) and false atom’s proof (cream box)). They can be leveraged
 to decompose the prediction of NEMESYS into relevance scores per (ground) atom (right). First, a
 standard forward reasoning is performed to compute the prediction. Then, the model’s prediction is
 backward propagated through the proof trees by applying specific decomposition rules, see main text.
 The numbers next to each (ground) atom are the relevance scores computed. The larger the score
 is, the more impact an (ground) atom has on the final prediction, and the line width is wider. For
 brevity, the complete proof tree is not depicted here. As our baseline comparison, we extend Deep
ProbLog [21] to DeepMetaProbLog. However, DeepMetaProbLog only provides proof tree for true
 atoms (top left blue box). (Best viewed in color)
 that NEMESYS achieves explainable reasoning by incorporating devised meta-level
 programs.
 Reasoning with Integrated Proof Tree Generation
 First, we demonstrate that NEMESYS can generate proof trees while performing
 reasoning, which the previous differentiable forward reasoners cannot produce since
 they encode the reasoning function to computational graphs using tensor operations
 and observe only their input and output. Since NEMESYS performs reasoning using
 meta-level programs, it can add the function to produce proof trees into its underlying
 reasoning mechanism simply by devising them, as illustrated in Fig 2.
 We use Kandinsky patterns [20], a benchmark of visual reasoning whose classifi
cation rule is defined on high-level concepts of relations and attributes of objects. We
 illustrate the input on the top right of Fig. 3 that belongs to a pattern: ”There are two
 pairs of objects that share the same shape.” Given the visual input, proof trees gen
erated using the ProofTreeInterpreter in Sec. 3.1 are shown on the left two boxes
 of Fig. 3. In this experiment, NEMESYS identified the relations between objects, and
 the generated proof trees explain the intermediate reasoning steps.
 Let’s first consider the top left blue box depicted in Fig. 3 (for readability, we
 only show the proof part of meta atoms in the image). The weighted ground atom
 0.98 :same
 shape
 pair(obj0,obj2) proves obj0 and obj2 are of the same shape with
 the probability 0.98. The proof part shows that NEMESYS comes to this conclusion
 since both objects are triangle with probabilities of 0.98 and in turn it can apply the
 rule for same
 shape
 pair. We use this example to show how to compute the weight of
 the meta atoms inside NEMESYS. With the proof-tree meta rules and corresponding
 meta ground atoms:
 0.98 : solve(shape(obj0, ),(shape(obj0, ),true).

Logical Relevance Proof Propagation (LRP2)
 Inspired by layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) [48], which produces explanations
 for feed-forward neural networks, we now show that, LRP can be adapted to logical
 reasoning systems using declarative languages in NEMESYS, thereby enabling the
 reasoning system to articulate the rationale behind its decisions, i.e., it can compute
 the importance of ground atoms for a query by having access to proof trees. We call
 this process: logical relevance proof propagation (LRP2).
 d
 The original LRP technique decomposes the prediction of the network, f(x), onto
 the input variables, x = (x1,...,xd), through a decomposition R = (R1,...,Rd) such
 that 
p=1 Rp = f(x) . Given the activation aj = ρ( iaiwij +bj) of neuron, where
 i and j denote the neuron indices at consecutive layers, and i and j represent
 the summation over all neurons in the respective layers, the propagation of LRP is
 defined as: Ri = jzij( izij)−1Rj, where zij is the contribution of neuron i to the
 activation aj, typically some function of activation ai and the weight wij. Starting
 from the output f(x), the relevance is computed layer by layer until the input variables
 are reached.
 To adapt this in NEMESYS to ground atoms and proof trees, we have to be a bit
 careful, since we cannot deal with the uncountable, infinite real numbers within our
 logic. Fortunately, we can make use of the weight associated with ground atoms. That
 is, our LRP2 composes meta-level atoms that represent the relevance of an atom given
 proof trees and associates the relevance scores to the weights of the meta-level atoms.
 To this end, we introduce three meta predicates: rp/3/[goal,proofs,atom]
 that represents the relevance score an atom has on the goal in given proofs,
 assert
 probs/1/[atom] that looks up the valuations of the ground atoms and maps
 the probability of the atom to its weight. rpf/2/[proof,atom] represents how much
 an atom contributes to the proof. The atom assert
 probs((Goal:-Body)) asserts the
 probability of the atom (Goal:-Body). With them, the meta-level program of LRP2 is:
 rp(Goal,Body,Atom):-assert
 assert
 probs((Goal:-Body)),
 probs(Body),rpf(Body,Atom).
 rpf([Atom,Tail],Atom):-assert
 probs(Atom).
 rpf([Head,Tail],Atom):-rpf(Tail,Atom).
 rpf([Head,Tail],Atom):-clause(Head,Body),rpf(Body,Atom).
 rpf([Head,Tail],Atom):-clause(Head,Body),rpf(Tail,Atom).
 rpf(Atom,Atom):-assert
 probs(Atom).
 rpf(Atom
 B, Atom):-norelate(Atom
 B, Atom).
 rp(Goal,[Proof,Proofs],Atom):-rp[Goal,[Proof],Atom].
 rp(Goal,[Proof,Proofs],Atom):-rp[Goal,Proofs,Atom].
 where rp(Goal,Proof,Atom) represents the relevance score an Atom has on the Goal
 in a Proof, i.e., we interpret the associated weight with atom rp(Goal,Proof,Atom)
 as the actual relevance score of Atom has on Goal given Proof. The higher the weight
 of rp(Goal,Proof,Atom) is, the larger the impact of Atom has on the Goal.
 12
Fig. 4 Visual Concept Repairing: NEMESYS achieves planning by performing differ
entiable meta-level reasoning. The left most image shows the start state, and the right most
 image shows the goal state. Taking these states as inputs, NEMESYS performs differentiable forward
 reasoning using meta-level clauses that simulate the planning steps and generate intermediate states
 (two images in the middle) and actions from start state to reach the goal state. (Best viewed in color)
 Let us go through the meta rules of LRP2. The first rule defines how to compute
 the relevance score of an Atom given the Goal under the condition of a Body (a single
 Proof). The relevance score is computed by multiplying the weight of the Body, the
 weight of a clause (Goal:-Body) and the importance score of the Atom given the Body.
 The second to the seventh rule defines how to calculate the importance score of an
 Atom given a Proof. These six rules loop over each atom of the given Proof, once it
 detects the Atom inside the given Proof, the importance score will be set to the weight
 of the Atom, another case is that the Atom is not in Proof, in that case, in the seventh
 rule, norelate will set the importance score to a small value. The eighth and ninth
 rules amalgamate the results from different proofs, i.e., the score from each proof tree
 is computed recursively during forward reasoning. The scores for the same target (the
 pair of Atom and Goal) are combined by the softor operation. The score of an atom
 given several proofs is computed by taking logical or softly over scores from each proof.
 With these nine meta rules at hand, together with the proof tree, NEMESYS is
 able to perform the relevance proof propagation for different atoms. We consider using
 the proof tree generated in Sec. 4.2 and set the goal as: same
 shape
 pair(obj0,obj2).
 Fig. 3 (right) shows LRP2-based explanations generated by NEMESYS. The relevance
 scores of different ground atoms are listed next to each (ground) atom. As we can see,
 the atoms shape(obj0, ) and shape(obj2, ) have the largest impact on the goal
 same
 shape
 pair(obj0,obj2), while shape(obj1, ) have much smaller impact.
 By providing proof tree and LRP2, NEMESYS computes the precise effect of a
 ground atom on the goal and produces an accurate proof to support its conclusion.
 This approach is distinct from the Most Probable Explanation (MPE) [49], which
 generates the most probable proof rather than the exact proof.
 4.3 Avoiding Infinite Loops
 Differentiable forward chaining [17], unfortunately, can generate infinite computations.
 A pathological example:
 edge(a,b). edge(b,a). edge(b,c). path(A,A,[ ]).
 path(A,C,[edge(A,B),path]):-edge(A,B),path(B,C,[path]).
 13
Test on 4 queries
 It defines a simple graph over three nodes (a,b,c) with three
 edges, (a − b,b − a,b − c) as well as paths in graphs in gen
eral. Specifically, path/3 defines how to find a path between
 two nodes in a recursive way. The base case is path(A,A,[]),
 meaning that any node A is reachable from itself. The recur
sion then says, if there is an edge from node A to node B,
 and there is a path from node B to node C, then there is a
 path from node A to node C. Unfortunately, this generates an
 infinite loop [edge(a,b),edge(b,a),edge(a,b),...] when com
puting the path from a to c, since this path can always be
 extended potentially also leading to the node c.
 Fortunately, NEMESYS allows one to avoid infinite loops
 by memorizing the proof-depth, i.e., we simply implement a
 limited proof-depth strategy on the meta-level:
 li((A,B),DPT):-li(A,DPT),li(B,DPT).
 li(A,DPT):-clause(A,B), DPT1 is DPT − 1, li(B,DPT1).

 gets
 the
 path
 path(a,c,[edge(a,b),edge(b,c)]) = true in three steps. For simplicity, we omit
 the proof part in the atom. Using the second rule and the first rule recur
sively, the meta interpreter finds clause(path(a,c),(edge(a,b),path(b,c))) and
 clause(path(b,c),(edge(b,c),path(c,c))). Finally, the meta interpreter finds a
 clause, whose head is li(path(c,c),1) and the body is true.
 Since forward chaining gets stuck in the infinite loop, we choose ProbLog [47] as our
 baseline comparison. We test NEMESYS and ProbLog using four queries, including
 one query which calls the recursive rule. ProbLog fails to return the correct answer on
 the query which calls the recursive rule. The comparison is summarized in Fig. 5. We
 provide the four test queries in Appendix A.
 4.4 Differentiable First-Order Logical Planning
 As the fourth meta interpreter, we demonstrate NEMESYS as a differentiable planner.
 Consider Fig. 4 where NEMESYS was asked to put all objects of a start image onto
 a line. Each start and goal state is represented as a visual scene, which is generated
 in the CLEVR [18] environment. By adopting a perception model, e.g., YOLO [42]
 or slot attention [45], NEMESYS obtains logical representations of the start and end
 states:
 start = {pos(obj0,(1,3)),...,pos(obj4,(2,1))},
 goal = {pos(obj0,(1,1)),...,pos(obj4,(5,5))},
 where pos/2 describes the 2-dim positions of objects. NEMESYS solves this planning
 task by performing differentiable reasoning using the meta-level program:
 plan(Start
 state,New
 state,Goal
 state,[Action,Old
 14
 stack]):
move(Action,Oldstate,Newstate),

 ability. Notably, given a causal Bayesian network, NEMESYS can perform the do
 operation (deleting the incoming edges of a node) [28] on arbitrary nodes and perform
 causal reasoning without the necessity of re-executing the entire system, which is made
 possible through meta-level programming.
 The do operator, denoted
 as do(X), is used to represent
 an intervention on a particular
 variable X in a causal learn
ing system, regardless of the
 actual value of the variable.
 For example, Fig. 6 shows a
 causal Bayesian network with
 three nodes and the probabil
ity distribution of the nodes
 before and after the do oper
ation. To investigate how the
 node Light affects the rest of
 the system, we firstly cut the
 causal relationship between the
 node Light and all its parent
 nodes, then we assign a new
 value to the node and we inves
tigate the probability of other
 nodes. To enable NEMESYS to perform a do operation on the node Light, we begin
 by representing the provided causal Bayesian network in Fig. 6 using:

 network, NEMESYS can easily perform the do operation
 (delete incoming edges) on arbitrary nodes and capture the
 causal effects on different nodes (for example, the probabil
ity of the node Light after intervening) without rerunning
 the entire system. Furthermore, NEMESYS is able to learn
 the unobserved do operation with its corresponding value
 using gradient descent based on the given causal graph and
 observed data. (Best viewed in color)

 where the number of an atom indicates the probability of the atom being true, and
 the number of a clause indicates the conditional probability of the head being true
 given the body being true.
 Wereuse the meta predicate assert
 probs/1/[atom] and introduce three new meta
 predicates: prob/1/[atom], probs/1/[atoms] and probs
 do/1/[atoms,atom]. Since we
 cannot deal with the uncountable, infinite real numbers within our logic, we make
 use of the weight associated with ground meta atoms to represent the probabil
ity of the atom. For example, we use the weight of the meta atom prob(Atom) to
 represent the probability of the atom Atom. We use the weight of the meta atom
 probs(Atoms) to represent the joint probability of a list of atoms Atoms, and the
 weight of probs
 do(AtomA,AtomB) to represent the probability of the atom AtomA after
 performing the do operation do(AtomB). We modify the meta interpreter as:
 prob(Head):-assert
 probs([Body
 probs((Head:-Body)),probs(Body).
 Atom,Body]):-prob(Body
 prob(Body

 where the first three rules calculate the probability of a node before the intervention,
 the joint probability is approximated using the first and second rule by iteratively
 multiplying each atom. The fourth rule assigns the probability of the atom Atom
 using the do operation. The fifth to the eighth calculate the probability after the do
 intervention by looping over each atom and multiplying them.
 For example, after performing do(Light) and setting the probability of Light as
 1.0. NEMESYS returns the weight of probs
 do(Light,Light) as the probability of
 the node Light (Fig. 6 red box) after the intervention do(Light).
 4.6 Gradient-based Learning in NEMESYS
 NEMESYS alleviates the limitations of frameworks such as DeepProbLog [21] by
 having the ability of not only performing differentiable parameter learning but also
 supporting differentiable structure learning (in our experiment, NEMESYS learns the
 weights of the meta rules while adapting to solve different tasks). We now introduce
 the learning ability of NEMESYS.
 4.6.1 Parameter Learning
 Consider a scenario in which a patient can only experience effective treatment when
 two types of medicine synergize, with the effectiveness contingent on the dosage of
 each drug. Suppose we have known the dosages of two medicines and the causal impact
 of the medicines on the patient, however, the observed effectiveness does not align
 with expectations. It is certain that some interventions have occurred in the medicine
patient causal structure (such as an incorrect dosage of one medicine, which will be
 treated as an intervention using the do operation). However, the specific node (patient
 or the medicines) on which the do operation is executed, and the values assigned to
 the do operator remain unknown. Conducting additional experiments on patients by
 altering medicine dosages to uncover the do operation is both unethical and dangerous.
 With NEMESYS at hand, we can easily learn the unobserved do operation with its
 assigned value. We abstract the problem using a three-node causal Bayesian network:
 1.0 : medicine
 a. 1.0 : medicine
 b. 0.9 : patient:-medicine
 a, medicine
 b.
 where the number of the atoms indicates the dosage of each medicine, and the number
 of the clause indicates the conditional probability of the effectiveness of the patient
 given these two medicines. Suppose there is only one unobserved do operation.
 To learn the unknown do operation, we define the loss as the Binary Cross Entropy
 (BCE) loss between the observed probability ptarget and the predicted probability
 of the target atom ppredicted. The predicted probability ppredicted is computed as:
 ppredicted = v(T) [IG(target atom)], where IG(x) is a function that returns the index of

 Fig. 7 NEMESYS performs differentiable parameter learning using gradient descent.
 Based on the given data (one or three targets), NEMESYS is asked to learn the correct do operator
 and its corresponding value (which we didn’t show in the images). The loss curve is averaged on three
 runs. The shadow area indicates the min and max number of the three runs. (Best viewed in color)
 target atom in G, v[i] is the i-th element of v. v(T) is the valuation tensor computed by
 T-step forward reasoning based on the initial valuation tensor v(0), which is composed
 of the initial valuation of do and other meta ground atoms. Since the valuation of do
 atom is the only changing parameter, we set the gradient of other parameters as 0.
 We minimize the loss w.r.t. do(X): minimize
 Lloss = BCE(ptarget,ppredicted(do(X))).
 do(X)
 Fig. 7 summarizes the loss curve of the three do operators during learning using one
 target (Fig. 7 left) and three targets (Fig. 7 right). For the three targets experiment,
 ptarget consists of three observed probabilities (the effectiveness of the patient and the
 dosages of two medicines), for the experiment with one target, ptarget only consists of
 the observed the effectiveness of the patient.
 Werandomly initialize the probability of the three do operators and choose the one,
 which achieves the lowest loss as the right do operator. In the three targets experiment,
 the blue curve achieves the lowest loss, with its corresponding value converges to the
 ground truth value, while in the one target experiment, three do operators achieve
 equivalent performance. We provide the value curves of three do operators and the
 ground truth do operator with its value in Appendix C.
 4.6.2 Structure Learning
 Besides parameter learning, NEMESYS can also perform differentiable structure learn
ing (we provide the candidate meta rules and learn the weights of these meta rules
 using gradient descent). In this experiment, different tasks are presented at distinct
 time steps throughout the learning process. NEMESYS is tasked with acquiring the
 ability to solve and adapt to these diverse tasks.
 Following Sec. 3.2, we make use of the meta rule weight matrix W = [w1,...,wM]
 to select the rules. We take the softmax of each weight vector wj ∈ W to choose M
 meta rules out of C meta rules. To adapt to different tasks, the weight matrix W
 is learned based on the loss, which is defined as the BCE loss between the probabil
ity of the target ptarget and the predicted probability ppredicted, where ppredicted is
 the probability of the target atoms calculated using the learned program. ppredicted
 is computed as: ppredicted = v(T) [IG(target atoms)], where IG(x) is a function that
 returns the indexes of target atoms in G, v[i] is the i-th element of v and v(T) is the

 Fig. 8 NEMESYS can learn to solve and adapt itself to different tasks during learn
ing using gradient descent. In this experiment, we train NEMESYS to solve three different tasks:
 causal reasoning, generating proof trees and naive meta reasoning sequentially (each task is repre
sented by a unique color encoding). The loss curve is averaged on five runs, with the shadow area
 indicating the minimum and maximum number of the five runs. For readability, the learned complete
 meta program is not shown in the image. (Best viewed in color)

Lloss=BCE(ptarget,ppredicted(W)).
 Werandomlyinitialize the weight matrix W, and update the weights using gradient
 descent. We set the target ptarget using positive target atoms and negative target
 atoms. For example, suppose we have the naive meta reasoning and generating proof
 tree as two tasks. To learn a program to generate the proof tree, we use the proof tree
 meta rules to generate positive examples, and use the naive meta rules to generate the
 negative examples.
 We ask NEMESYS to solve three different tasks sequentially, which is initially,
 calculating probabilities using the first three rules of causal reasoning, then execut
ing naive meta-reasoning. Finally, generating a proof tree. We set the program size
 to three and randomly initialize the weight matrix. Fig. 8 shows the learning pro
cess of NEMESYS which can automatically adapt to solve these three different tasks.
 We provide the accuracy curve and the candidate rules with the learned weights in
 Appendix D. We also compare NEMESYS with the baseline method DeepProbLog [21]
 (cf. Table. 4). Due to the limitations of DeepProbLog in adapting (meta) rule weights
 during learning, we initialize DeepProbLog with three variants as our baseline com
parisons. The first variant involves fixed task 1 meta rule weights (1.0), with task 2
 and task 3 meta rule weights being randomly initialized. In the second variant, task 2

 meta rule weights are fixed (1.0), while task 1 and task 3 meta rule weights are ran
domly initialized, and this pattern continues for the subsequent variant. We provide
 NEMESYS with the same candidate meta rules, however, with randomly initialize
 weights. We compute the accuracy at iteration 200, 400 and 600.
 4.7 Discussion
 While NEMESYS achieves impressive results, it is worth considering some of the
 limitations of this work. In our current experiments for structure learning, candi
dates of meta-rules are provided. It is promising to integrate rule-learning techniques,
 e.g., mode declarations, meta-interpretive learning, and a more sophisticated rule
 search, to learn from less prior. Another limitation lies in the calculation, since our
 system is not able to handle real number calculation, we make use of the weight
 associated with the atom to approximate the value and do the calculation.
 5 Conclusions
 We proposed the framework of neuro-metasymbolic reasoning and learning. We
 realized a differentiable meta interpreter using the differentiable implementation
 of first-order logic with meta predicates. This meta-interpreter, called NEMESYS,
 achieves various important functions on differentiable logic programming languages
 using meta-level programming. We illustrated this on different tasks of visual rea
soning, reasoning with explanations, reasoning with infinite loops, planning on visual
 scenes, performing the do operation within a causal Bayesian network and showed
 NEMESYS’s gradient-based capability of parameter learning and structure learning.
 NEMESYS provides several interesting avenues for future work. One major limi
tation of NEMESYS is its scalability for large-scale meta programs. So far, we have
 mainly focused on specifying the syntax and semantics of new (domain-specific) dif
ferentiable logic programming languages, helping to ensure that the languages have
 some desired properties. In the future, one should also explore providing properties
 about programs written in a particular differentiable logic programming language and
 injecting the properties into deep neural networks via algorithmic supervision [50], as
 well as program synthesis. Most importantly, since meta programs in NEMESYS are
 parameterized, and the reasoning mechanism is differentiable, one can realize differ
entiable meta-learning easily, i.e., the reasoning system that learns how to perform
 reasoning better from experiences.

 show the goal state. Taking these states as inputs, NEMESYS performs differentiable forward reason
ing using meta-level clauses that simulate the planning steps and generate actions from start state
 to reach the goal state. (Best viewed in color)
 A Queries for Avoiding Infinite Loop
 We use four queries to test the performance of NEMESYS and ProbLog [47].The four
 queries include one query which calls the recursive rule. The queries are:
 query(path(a,a,[])). query(path(b,b,[])).
 query(path(c,c,[])). query(path(a,c,A)).
 B Differentiable Planning
 We provide more planning tasks in Figure. 9 with varying numbers of objects and
 attributes. Given the initial states and goal states, NEMESYS is asked to provide the
 intermediate steps to move different objects from start states to the end states.
 C Differentiable Parameter Learning Value Curve
 We also provide the corresponding value curve of these different do operators during
 learning in Fig. 10. In the experiment, we choose the do operator which achieves the
 lowest value as the correct value, thus in the experiment with three targets, we choose
 do(medicine
 a) with value 0.8, which is exactly the ground-truth do operator with
 the correct number.
 D Multi-Task Adaptation
 Wealso compute the accuracy on the test splits of three tasks during the learning pro
cess (Fig. 12 dashed line, color encoded). We choose DeepProbLog [21] as our baseline
 comparison method in this experiment, however, learning the weights of (meta) rules
 is not supported in DeepProbLog framework, thus we randomly initialized the weights
 of the meta rules and compute the loss (Fig 11).
 In this paragraph, we provide the meta program learned by NEMESYS in the
 experiment. The weights of meta rules are color coded to visually represent how their
 values evolve during the learning process (the weights are provided at iteration 200,
 400 and 600), as illustrated in the accompanying Fig. 12.

 Abstract. Ontologies are used in various domains, with RDF and OWL
 being prominent standards for ontology development. RDF is favored for
 its simplicity and flexibility, while OWL enables detailed domain knowl
edge representation. However, as ontologies grow larger and more expres
sive, reasoning complexity increases, and traditional reasoners struggle
 to perform efficiently. Despite optimization efforts, scalability remains
 an issue. Additionally, advancements in automated knowledge base con
struction have led to the creation of large and expressive ontologies that
 are often noisy and inconsistent, posing further challenges for conven
tional reasoners. To address these challenges, researchers have explored
 neuro-symbolic approaches that combine neural networks’ learning capa
bilities with symbolic systems’ reasoning abilities. In this chapter, we pro
vide an overview of the existing literature in the field of neuro-symbolic
 deductive reasoning supported by RDF(S), EL, ALC, and OWL 2 RL,
 discussing the techniques employed, the tasks they address, and other
 relevant efforts in this area.
 1 Introduction
 Ontologies are used to represent knowledge in several domains, such as health
care, geoscience, IoT, and e-commerce. In recent years, there has been an uptake
 in expressing ontologies using the Resource Description Framework (RDF)3 [1]
 and the Web Ontology Language (OWL)4 [2], the prominent W3C recommended
 standards for ontology development. The strength of these knowledge representa
tion languages is automated reasoning, which can be used for various purposes,
 such as conceptual query answering, data retrieval, and data integration [3].
 RDF, while having limited expressivity, is popular because of its simplicity and
 f
 lexibility to model data in diverse domains [4]. On the other hand, OWL, which

 Singh et al.
 is based on Description Logics (DLs)5 [5], provides a range of language construc
tors (Table 1) for capturing the domain knowledge in detail.
 Since RDF has limited expressivity, most of the commonly used reasoners6
 perform quite well on these ontologies. However, as the ontologies grow larger
 or become more expressive, for example, the ones in OWL 2 DL [2], whose for
mal underpinning is the highly expressive description logic, SROIQ [6], the
 reasoning complexity also increases. The current reasoners struggle to perform
 efficiently on such ontologies. Modern reasoning systems typically employ a wide
 range of optimizations to improve performance. Based on the intended applica
tion, these optimizations may fall into different categories (pre-processing, model
 construction, and reasoning task-dependent optimizations) [7]. However, despite
 all the research on optimizing the performance of traditional reasoning systems,
 they still suffer from poor scalability on large and expressive ontologies [8]. Fur
thermore, with the advancements in automated knowledge base construction7,
 building large and expressive ontologies has become relatively easy. However,
 such ontologies are often noisy and inconsistent, and the conventional ontology
 reasoners cannot deal with such ontologies [9].
 To come up with a solution to deal with large, expressive, noisy, and inconsis
tent ontologies, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches [10] that
 combine the robust learning capabilities of the neural networks and the precise
 reasoning abilities of the symbolic systems. This chapter presents a survey of ex
isting neuro-symbolic deductive reasoning techniques for RDF and description
 logics and discusses their benefits, limitations, and scope. Before we do so, let
 us point out that we exclude works that use machine learning techniques for
 knowledge graph completion (KGC)8, techniques for different ontology comple
tion tasks, such as ontology learning for assisting ontology engineering, enrich
ment [11,12] and for introducing approximate class definitions that are not part
 of the standard ontology languages [13] and also predicting assertions in an on
tology [14,15]. Specifically, we discuss only those works that focus on deductive
 reasoning over ontologies. Such techniques infer only logically derivable facts
 from explicitly stated domain knowledge. The conventional deductive ontology
 reasoners are based on mathematical logic-based reasoning algorithms such as
 tableau calculi and inference rule-based methods (Section 2.2).
 This chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview of on
tology languages, followed by different traditional and neuro-symbolic reasoning
 techniques. Although there are several different description logics (ALC,SRIF,
 SROIQ, etc.) [6], and several OWL 2 profiles (EL, QL, RL, and DL) [2], the
 body of work in the neuro-symbolic reasoning category is limited. Hence, we only
 briefly discuss the ontology languages that are supported by neuro-symbolic rea
soning techniques such as RDF(S), EL, ALC, and OWL 2 RL. Section 3 discusses
 5 Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between OWL and DLs, we use those two
 terms interchangeably here.

 the existing literature in the neuro-symbolic deductive reasoning space. In sec
tion 3.5, we give a brief overview of the techniques discussed in the chapter in
 terms of the techniques used, tasks handled by each work, and so on. We also
 discuss a few complementary efforts in Section 4 that push the research in the
 ontology reasoning domain, such as reasoner evaluation challenges and ontology
 benchmarks. We conclude in Section 5.
 2 Preliminaries
 2.1 Ontology Languages
 With the increasing interest in the Semantic Web [16,17] in the early 2000s,
 ontologies [18] were used in various application domains such as healthcare, geo
science, IoT, and e-commerce to describe knowledge about entities in that par
ticular domain. The basic building blocks of an ontology are entities: Concepts
 (C), Relations (R), and Individuals (I). Concepts denote sets of individ
uals, Relations denote binary relations between individuals, and individual
 names denote a single individual in the domain. For example, an ontology rep
resenting the University domain might use concepts such as Student and
 Faculty to denote the set of all students and faculties in the university, relations
 such as teaches and hasClassmate to denote the binary relationships between
 faculty, course, and students, and individual names such as alex and mary to
 denote the individuals alex and mary. Note that, depending on the language,
 Concept may sometimes be referred to as Class, Relation as Properties or
 Roles, and Individuals as Constants. But, to keep the terminology consistent,
 we will stick to the terms Concept, Relation, and Individual throughout the
 survey (irrespective of the language addressed).
 Definition 1 (Ontology). An Ontology O, is a set of statements, called ax
ioms, that is used to describe knowledge about a particular domain. These ax
ioms can be categorized as a triplet = (TBox, ABox, RBox). Let NC, NR, and
 NI be countable, and pairwise disjoint sets of concept names, relation names,
 and individual names, respectively. TBox is the set of terminological axioms de
scribing the relationships between named concept expressions/concepts, C ∈ NC.
 Every terminological axiom is in the form of A ⊑ B (concept inclusion) or A ≡ B
 (concept equivalence), such that A, B ∈ NC. ABox is the set of assertions describ
ing relationships among individuals a, b ∈ NI via relation R (relation assertion)
 ∈ NR aswell as instantiation relationships (concept assertion) between elements
 of NI and NC. RBox is the set of relational axioms describing different properties
 of relations.
 RDF(S) [1] and OWL 2(the latest version of OWL) [2] are the two prominent
 W3C recommended standards for ontology development that provide several
 language constructors to model the information in a given domain. As mentioned
 earlier, OWL and DLs have a one-to-one correspondence. OWL 2 is based on
 DL SROIQ. Table 1 presents different subsets of constructs offered. Below are
 a few examples to distinguish between TBox, ABox, and RBox of an ontology.

 UG student is a concept
 * UGStudent ≡ Student ⊓ ∃enrollFor.Course

 * UGStudent ⊑ Student
 UG student is a subclass of Student (rdfs:subClassOf)– ABox
 * UGStudent(alex)
 alex is a UG Student (Concept Assertion)
 * teaches(mary, alex)
 mary teaches alex (Relation Assertion)– RBox
 * Symmetric(hasClassmate)
 hasClassmate is a symmetric object property
 * Irreflexive(teaches)
 teaches is an irreflexive object property
 The Resource Description Framework (RDF), which includes RDF Schema
 (RDFS), is an established and widely used W3C standard for expressing knowl
edge graphs. An RDF graph, G, is a directed, labeled graph that consists of a
 set of triples of the form (s, p, o) where the subject s and object o form the
 graph nodes and the predicate p forms the graph edges, where subject s ∈ NC
 or NI, and object o ∈ NC, NI or Literals, and the predicate p ∈ NR denote
 the binary relation between the nodes s and o.
 RDFSchema(RDFS)isasemantic extension of basic RDF that provides sev
eral constructs such as rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:Class,
 rdfs:Resource, rdfs:Literal, and rdfs:Datatype to express simple taxonomies
 and hierarchies among entities. RDF(S) can be used to create lightweight on
tologies, and the information in an RDFS ontology can also be represented as
 a directed, labeled graph. Note that we use RDF(S) to refer to both RDF and
 RDFS.
 OWL, built on top of RDFS, offers more language constructs. The basic
 building blocks of OWL are concepts (C), relations (R), and individuals (I),
 which can be put into relationships (called axioms) with each other using dif
ferent modeling constructs, as shown in Figure 1. The sets C, R, and I must be
 mutually disjoint. All or a set of these constructs could be utilized depending on
 the intended application and desired reasoning performance.
 OWL2[19], the latest version of OWL, is based on DL SROIQ. Since DLs
 are a family of first-order logics (FOL) [20], formal semantics are defined for this
 language. An interpretation I = (∆I,.I), where ∆I, a non-empty set, called the
 domain of I (representing all the things existing in the world that I represent),
 and .I is the interpretation function that maps every individual, concept, and
 relation in NI, NC, and NR, to an element, subset and binary relation in ∆I
 with function .I. For an interpretation I, the function .I is defined in (Table 1).
 OWL 2 has several sublanguages or profiles (EL, QL, RL, DL, and Full) [2],
 which are overlapping subsets of DL language constructs. In simpler terms, an

 OWLontology could be referred to in terms of one of these profiles (for instance,
 OWL2DLontology) or a (subset) combination of different DL constructs (such
 as SHIQ, ALCH, or SHOIN).
 Different DL constructs (Table 1) have different computational properties.
 Some are easier to reason over than others. Since the reasoning performance
 decreases with an increase in expressivity, the primary purpose of the differ
ent DLs (formed by various combinations of constructs) is that they enable a
 balance between ontology expressivity and reasoning complexity depending on
 the intended application. For example, a lightweight DL, EL, provides only a
 few concept constructors, which can be reasoned over in polynomial time w.r.t.
 the size of the ontology, even in the worst case. Two extensions of EL, EL+,
 and EL++ support a few more concept constructors to make the ontology more
 expressive. EL+ additionally supports relation inclusion and composition. On
 top of that, EL++ further includes concept disjointness, transitive and reflexive
 relations, along with concept and role assertions. So, for applications where rea
soning time is a significant concern, such DLs enable efficient implementations
 for even large ontologies. More expressive DLs (often termed semi-expressive
 DLs), such as ALC, allow for including conjunction, disjunction, negation, ex
istential and universal quantification in the domain description. Finally, highly
 expressive DL SROIQ [6] provides an extensive range of language constructs to
 represent an application domain. Reasoning over such expressive DLs is typically
 less efficient compared to simpler ones. However, the additional expressiveness
 can be helpful (and, in some cases, required) in practice to accurately represent
 the application domain’s constraints.
 Each OWL2profile [19] consists of different (overlapping) subsets of DL con
structs and hence vary in terms of their expressivity and reasoning complexity.– OWL 2 EL(Existential Logic). Based on the DL EL++ and designed to
 be lightweight and allow polynomial time reasoning.– OWL2QL(QueryLogic). Based on DL-Lite family of DLs and is designed
 to give easier access to a large amount of instance data.– OWL2RL(RulesLogic). Based on DLP and pD* and designed to interact
 with rule-based reasoners.– OWL2DL(Description Logics). Highly expressive, based on SROIQ and
 has the reasoning complexity of N2EXPTIME.– OWL 2 Full. Undecidable.
 Each of these profiles has some restrictions in terms of syntax. To illustrate
 the syntactic limits imposed on the usage of different constructs in each OWL 2
 profile, we use existential restriction for the statement, A faculty is an employee
 who teaches some course. The syntax in each OWL 2 profile varies, as shown
 below.– In OWL 2 EL, Faculty ≡ Employee ⊓ ∃teaches.Course– In OWL 2 QL, Faculty ⊑ Employee ⊓ ∃teaches.Course (existential re
strictions are not allowed in the subclass expression)
Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length
 7– In OWL 2 RL, Employee ⊓ ∃teaches.Course ⊑ Faculty (existential re
strictions are not allowed in the superclass expression)– In OWL 2 DL, Faculty ≡ Employee ⊓ =1teaches.Course (since qualified
 exact cardinalities are supported, we could make the axiom more expressive
 by writing it using exact cardinality)
 2.2 Reasoning
 The conventional ontology reasoning methods employ mathematical algorithms,
 such as tableau and inference rule-based methods, to perform different reason
ing tasks. These algorithms, in contrast to learning-based approaches, are capa
ble of deriving every possible conclusion (completeness) with absolute certainty
 (soundness) in a finite amount of time (termination). However, the conventional
 methods, despite a range of optimizations, need to scale better for large and ex
pressive ontologies. In addition, these algorithms assume the integrity of the data
 and can not deal with noisy and inconsistent ontologies. Hence, neuro-symbolic
 techniques come into the picture because they are often highly scalable and
 have the added advantage of dealing with noise and providing robust learning
 abilities.
 Before moving on to the existing neuro-symbolic literature, it is crucial to
 understand the terminologies involved and what exactly (such as conventional
 reasoning methods or tasks) the neuro-symbolic reasoners try to emulate. This
 section briefly discusses the most relevant conventional reasoning methods for
 RDF(S) and DLs, followed by a general idea of neuro-symbolic reasoning in the
 context of this survey.
 Conventional Reasoning Methods The existing reasoning systems support
 a range of reasoning tasks. Depending on the intended application, these systems
 could be query-based, which tells whether a given logical expression is a logical
 consequence of the provided ontology or generates all the deductive inferences in
 a single run. For the latter case, the tasks that are typically considered standard
 for ontology reasoning and are supported by most reasoning systems are as
 follows.– Consistency Checking. Determines whether the given set of axioms is
 consistent, i.e., no entity violates or contradicts the given ontology definition.– Satisfiability. Determines whether a description of the concept is not con
tradictory, i.e., checks whether at least one individual satisfies the given
 concept description.– Classification. Determines the subsumption hierarchies for all the concepts
 and relations.– Realization. Determines all the concepts to which the individual belongs
 (often called Concept Membership), especially the most specific ones.– Entailment. Determines all the logical consequences (including classifica
tion and realization) that follow from the given ontology, provided the on
tology is consistent.
8
 Singh et al.
 From the point of view of conventional reasoners, the following aspects are typ
ically investigated to measure the effectiveness of the implemented reasoning
 algorithms.– Soundness. Aprocedure is called sound if it derives only those consequences
 that logically follow from the represented axioms.– Completeness. A procedure is called complete if the procedure can derive
 all the logical consequences that follow from the given ontology.– Termination. A procedure should compute sound and complete answers in
 a finite amount of time.– Scalability. Indicates how the reasoner performs for varying sizes of ontol
ogy (in terms of axiom count and type of language constructs used). The
 performance is typically measured in terms of reasoning time taken and
 memory consumed.
 Both soundness and completeness are strongly desired features, but in some
 cases, completeness can be compromised to obtain faster results.
 Tableau-Based Methods. For DLs, all the reasoning tasks are reducible to
 consistency checking. Hence it is sufficient to have a procedure that only deter
mines whether or not ontologies are consistent. Let C be a concept, and I be an
 interpretation. The aim of the tableau algorithm [6] is to generate a finite inter
pretation I such that CI= ∅. Without loss of generality, we assume all concept
 descriptions are in the negation normal form (NNF) [16]. Tableau expansion
 starts with an ontology, A:= C(x), and the tableau expansion rules are applied
 sequentially until all constraints are satisfied, or an obvious contradiction is de
tected. This leads to a form of a search tree (Figure 1), with the root node
 C(x). Here, the edges represent the applied tableau rules. We call our ontology
 A consistent if and only if one of the complete ABoxes is open, i.e., does not
 contain an obvious contradiction of the form {A(x),¬A(x)}. These rules may be
 deterministic (such as conjunction) or non-deterministic (such as disjunction).
 The second type of rule might lead to the wrong path and require backtracking.
 Thus, with the increase in the size or expressivity of the ontologies, the tree be
comes broader and deeper, leading to a huge search space. Hence, the reasoning
 complexity increases exponentially.
 Inference Rule-Based Methods. Inference rule-based reasoners are widely
 used and well-known for bottom-up reasoning techniques that derive all the
 inferences by applying inference rules to the set of axioms in the input ontology
 iteratively (repeatedly). There are thirteen rules (called entailment rules) for
 RDFS (Table 2) that can be used to entail new facts in an RDFS ontology.
 Since RDFS has very low expressivity and axioms are in the form of triples,
 reasoning algorithms are very straightforward. However, for EL+, the axioms
 are more complex than RDFS. So, usually, some preprocessing has to be done
 before applying the rules, such as all the axioms have to be in the standard
 normal form: C ⊑ D,C1 ⊓C2 ⊑ D,C ⊑ ∃R.D,∃R. ⊑ D,R1 ⊓R,R1 o R2 ⊓R.
 The standard reasoning task over EL+ is called classification. The inference
Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

 rules (called completion rules) (Table 3) can be applied to EL+ axioms in a
 given EL+ ontology to derive all the possible consequences. These approaches
 have also been extended to DLs with nondeterministic language features, e.g.,
 ALCH and ALCI (refer to [21] for more details).
 An important point to note is that for the conventional logical reasoning
 algorithms, the entities in an ontology need not necessarily have an actual (real
world) meaning. The reasoner processes the axioms based on the defined rules
 and has nothing to do with entity names. For example, in inference-based meth
ods, all the inferences are derived by the application of rules. For the axioms,
 Man ⊑ Mortal and Man(socrates), imply Mortal(socrates). If we replace Man,
 socrates, and Mortal with random names A, x, and B, respectively, then, A
 ⊑ B and A(x) will imply B(x). Even for the case of tableau-based reasoners, a
 consistent renaming across the whole ontology would not change the outcome of
 the reasoning task at hand.

 ontology reasoners. This could be done by learning the embeddings of the enti
ties involved in the ontology or by learning the reasoning steps followed by the
 conventional tableau or inference rule-based systems. In contrast to conventional
 reasoning approaches, these approaches aren’t sound and complete. They work
 by finding a balance between approximating the precise reasoning abilities of the
 symbolic systems and utilizing the robust learning capabilities of learning-based
 techniques.
 From the point of view of evaluating a neuro-symbolic reasoning procedure,
 the key aspects [22], in addition to the previously discussed conventional rea
soning evaluation measures, are as follows.– Transferability. Indicates whether the system can transfer the knowledge
 learned during training to previously unknown and unseen ontology domains.
 As in the case of conventional logic-based algorithms, the reasoning systems
 are independent of the meaning of the entities in the ontology. Although the
 knowledge is not transferable for conventional reasoners, the same set of rules
 and reasoning algorithms are applicable across domains. The goal is that the
 neuro-symbolic reasoner should be able to learn the abstraction irrespective
 of the textual meaning of the entities, and hence, the learned knowledge can
 be transferred to new ontologies and would not need retraining.– Generative Capability. Indicates whether the system can generate all
 inferences in one run (in a finite amount of time) or if it is query-based, i.e.,
 predicts the answer to the specific query or checks whether or not a given
 logical expression is a logical consequence of the provided ontology.– Transparency. The ability of the neuro-symbolic systems to provide a
 derivation of the inferred triples and provide an explanation for the predic
tions. Neural networks are generally black boxes and cannot be inspected. So,
 this aspect indicates whether the proposed method incorporates the trans
parency offered by the conventional reasoning methods.– Accuracy. The performance of a neuro-symbolic reasoning system, in con
trast to conventional methods that are both sound and complete, is normally
 measured in terms of the number of correct predictions made for each query
 or correct inferences drawn (such as precision, recall, or f-measure) from an
 input ontology.
 Logical Embeddings. Recent years have witnessed the successful application
 of low-dimensional vector space representations of knowledge graphs [23] for
 the knowledge graph completion tasks, such as predicting missing links and
 new facts [24,25]. The primary goal is to capture and preserve the underlying
 properties of the given knowledge base in the vector form. However, it is not
 yet well understood to what extent ontological knowledge, e.g., given as a set of
 axioms, can be embedded in a principled way. The goal of logical embeddings
 for ontologies is two-fold.
 1. The learned embedding should disregard the textual meanings of all the
 entities in the ontology and retain the syntax (type and order of constructs),
 and capture the interconnection and interplay between the axioms.
12
 Singh et al.
 2. The learning should be transferable either by learning the embedding for
 each entity and using those for ontology completion or query answering
 across domains or by learning the functioning of each construct involved in
 the ontology. The latter case is preferred for emulating conventional logical
 reasoning.
 Intelligent Decision Making. Despite all the research for optimizing the per
formance of traditional reasoning systems, they still do not scale well. One of
 the reasons is that a tableau expansion still has a large degree of freedom in
 deciding which rule on which node should be applied next, as well as in which
 order it wants to evaluate the nondeterministic alternatives. The former choice
 does not make a huge difference because if there is a model, it will be found by
 any order of rule expansions. However, for the latter case, the choice is relevant
 because out of available choices, one choice may lead to the successful construc
tion of a model, while another might lead to a clash and will have to be dealt
 with by a backtracking search. In the worst case, such a search must consider
 all non-deterministic choices and this can have a tremendous impact on the size
 of the search tree and, therefore, on the reasoning performance. Figure 2 shows
 different partial expansions for a single set of axioms [16]. Numbers indicate the
 order in which the tableau is expanded. Out of these three expansions, partial
 expansion 3 is the ideal choice for a reasoner because it took the least steps to
 reach an open branch. So, the ideal heuristic is one that will lead to the con
clusion in the least number of steps. But, it is more important not to choose a
 bad heuristic because a bad decision might lead to a very broad and deep search
 tree, degrading the reasoning performance tremendously.

 3 Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning: State-of-the-art
 13
 In this article, by examining the state-of-the-art, we plan to answer the following
 research questions.
 Q1 Can neural networks learn to emulate logical reasoning?
 An answer to this question is, in turn, dependent on the following questions.
 Q1.1 What are the different neural network architectures and the correspond
ing algorithms to learn logical reasoning?
 Q1.2 How can ontologies and, in general, logical axioms and constructs be
 represented in a form suitable for different neural network architectures
 and algorithms?
 Q2 How capable are the learned models in comparison to conventional RDF and
 description logic reasoners?
 Q2.1 Can they handle noisy and inconsistent ontologies?
 An ideal neuro-symbolic reasoner should support the most expressive logic,
 be transferable to different domains, be able to generate all and only cor
rect inferences in a single run, and explain the generated consequences at a
 massive scale and with high performance. So the other important question
 is the following.
 Q2.2 To what extent can neuro-symbolic approaches support these features that
 were also discussed in Section 2.2?
 In order to evaluate these features, it is important to have benchmarks
 that can be used to test and compare different neuro-symbolic reasoning
 systems.
 Q3 What are the metrics that can be used to evaluate the features of the neuro
symbolic reasoning systems?
 3.1 RDF
 Since RDF data can be represented as directed, labeled graphs, this information
 in machine learning scenarios has been utilized in two different forms– general
 graph kernels [26] and vector space embeddings [27]. With graph-based represen
tations, other than the benefit of improved readability, embeddings can capture
 the neighborhood information (context) of each entity. So the most intuitive
 form to use is representing ontology as a graph that can capture the syntax,
 but this is a complex task. Several graph models (such as bipartite, hypergraph,
 and metagraph) [28,29,30] have been explored for different purposes ranging
 from storing and querying RDF graphs to reducing space and time-complexity
 to solving the reification and provenance problem. [31] Unfortunately, they are
 not suitable for RDFS reasoning, and these graph forms cannot be provided as
 input to neural networks because the complex graph forms make it harder for
 the neural networks to learn from.
 Kernel methods refer to machine learning algorithms that learn by comparing
 pairs of data points using similarity (or dissimilarity) measures and work directly
14
 Singh et al.
 on graphs without having to do feature extraction to transform them into fixed
length, real-valued feature vectors. The distance between two data instances is
 computed by counting common substructures in the graphs of the instances, i.e.,
 walks, paths, and trees [32]. However, only a few approaches are general enough
 to be applied to any given RDF graph, let alone OWL ontologies. In one of the
 earliest works in this category, L¨osch et al. [33] introduced two general RDF
 graph kernels based on intersection graphs and intersection trees. Later, de Vries
 et al. [34] simplified the intersection tree path kernel and proposed a better and
 faster variant for RDF of the general Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel for graphs. In
 another work, de Vries et al. [35] showed an improvement in the computational
 time of the kernel when applied to RDF by introducing an approximation of the
 state-of-the-art Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel algorithm.
 In the vector space embedding, the initial works adapted neural language
 models, such as Word2Vec [27], for embedding entities present in the input on
tology. Such approaches work on the assumption that closer words in the word
 sequences are more associated. As shown in Figure 3, the main step is to gen
erate sequences that can be considered similar to sentences in natural language.
 These sequences could either be obtained directly from the axioms [36,37] or
 generated from the ontology graphs [38]. Evidently, for the latter case, it is
 important to have a graphical representation of the ontologies. Once we have
 the graphs corresponding to the input ontology, several sequences are generated,
 and these sequences are used to train language models to generate the entity
 embeddings that capture the likelihood of a sequence of entities. After the train
ing is completed, all the entities are projected into a lower-dimensional feature
 space, and semantically similar entities are positioned close to each other. These
 word embeddings can be exploited for tasks related to query answering, ontology
 completion (such as link prediction and fact prediction), and ontology reasoning
 (such as predicting concept membership and subsumption).
 Fig.3. Ontology to vector representation pipeline
 The initial work, RDF2Vec [32] by Ristoski et al., leverages graph walks for
 transforming the RDF graph to token sequences, and then a natural language
 embedding algorithm such as Word2Vec [27] is applied to the sequence docu
ment that generates embeddings based on token co-occurrences. Word2vec is a
 computationally-efficient two-layer neural network model for learning word em
beddings from raw text. For generating the sequences, two approaches were used;
 a graph walk based on the breadth-first algorithm and Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree
 RDF graph kernel, an efficient kernel for graph comparison [39]. The RDF2vec
 evaluations prove the feasibility and scalability of the graph walk-based methods

 over kernel methods. Since the embeddings are created using language models,
 the language(RDF) semantics are ignored. However, RDF2Vec could be used to
 study the distributional properties of RDF data, and the pre-trained embeddings
 can be reused in different deep neural network architectures. Later, intending to
 capture the most important information for each entity and make the walks less
 random, Cochez et al. [40] introduced biases to the walks, which led to signifi
cant improvements. Along with the edge labels, they augmented each edge with
 weight using twelve different strategies. Whenever a walk arrives at a vertex,
 a probability is computed for the possible edges that decide whether to take
 that edge. Hence, these weights bias the random walks on the graph. Although
 both the works by Ristoski et al. and Cochez et al. [32,40] were evaluated for
 several tasks, such as entity relatedness, the approach is suitable for handling
 link prediction and fact prediction tasks. In OPA2Vec [36], and Onto2Vec [37],
 a similar approach as RDF2Vec was used. In Onto2Vec, Smaili et al. uses the
 axioms of an RDFS ontology as the corpus, that is, it treats each axiom as a
 sentence for training, while in OPA2Vec, Smaili et al. complements the corpus
 of Onto2Vec with the lexical information provided by ontology metadata, such
 as rdfs:comment and rdfs:label. This metadata could potentially provide valu
able information about different aspects of the entities. The approaches were
 evaluated for predicting protein-protein interaction, but the embeddings could
 be used for graph completion as well. Since these methods treat each axiom as
 a sentence and do not utilize the interconnections offered by graph structures,
 it is hard to explore the entity correlations and the logical relation between ax
ioms. Also, considering only the axioms as sentences might lead to a shortage of
 training corpus for small to medium-scale ontologies. The fundamental method
 that these walk-based techniques employed were further extended to other types
 of logic as well, for example, OWL2Vec [41]. The ontology embedding methods
 based on these walk-based embeddings convert the ontology to a graphical form
 that can capture the logical structure and inter-entity relationships. Modeling
 RDF(S) ontologies as graphs is easy. However, OWL ontologies include not only
 graph structure but also logical constructors, and entities are often augmented
 with richer lexical information specified using rdfs:label, rdfs:comment, and
 many other built-in annotation properties. So modeling OWL axioms as graphs
 is a complex problem. The general assumption for such techniques is that sim
pler logic can easily be represented as graphs than more expressive logic, and
 hence OWL ontologies were projected to RDF graphs [42] to perform walks. To
 create embeddings, a series of graph walks were conducted, and the sequences
 were collected in a document. Similar to RDF2Vec, word2vec is used to train
 the embeddings. But, this approach did not fully capture the logical and lexi
cal information in the graph. Later, Chen et al. introduced OWL2Vec* [38], an
 extension of OWL2Vec. OWL2Vec* intending to capture the structure, logical
 constructors involved in each axiom, and the relationship between entities across
 axioms, generates three documents by walking over the graph. Each document
 consists of a corpus that captures different aspects of the ontology (i) the graph
 structure (obtained from the projected RDF graph) and the logic constructors
16
 Singh et al.
 (obtained from the ontology axioms), (ii) the lexical information (obtained from
 the annotation axioms, comments, and definitions), and (iii) a combination of
 corpus from steps (i) and (ii). After the documents are created, they are com
bined into a single document as one corpus. Finally, OWL2Vec* uses a word
 embedding model to create embeddings of entities from the generated corpus.
 The performance was evaluated for concept subsumption and membership tasks.
 Later on, the advent of deep learning opened doors for new research direc
tions. Hohenecker and Lukasiewicz [43] proposed Relational Tensor Networks
 (RTN), an adaptation of Recursive Neural Tensor Networks (RNTN) [44] for
 relational learning. RNTN was initially designed to support learning from tree
structured data. RTN is an RNTN that makes use of a bilinear tensor layer. The
 term relational in an RTN emphasizes the focus on relational datasets. The in
tuition is that the most critical information about individuals is hidden in their
 relations. The authors start by building a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) repre
sentation of the input RDF ontology where directed edges represent the binary
 relations, and each of the vertices represents the individuals. Each individual
 is represented as an incidence vector that indicates the concepts they belong
 to. The embeddings of the individuals are computed using the RTN model that
 considers the type or the relation each individual has. They consider two tasks,
 type prediction (membership of individuals to concepts) and relation prediction.
 The input for relation prediction is the embeddings of two individuals for which
 the relations are being classified. The results reported on large datasets for both
 predictive performance (on concept and relationship prediction) and time con
sumption (for import and materialization) showed performance improvements
 compared to RDFox. However, to generate DAG, traditional reasoners (Apache
 Jena10, Pellet11) were used. Due to this, RTN is not noise-tolerant. For learn
ing, the datasets (including the inferences) were divided into training, test, and
 validation sets, meaning the performance is reported on the same ontology, and
 learning is not transferable to other domains. In order to ensure that there is
 sufficient data for training, only those relations were considered that appear in
 at least 5% of the total individuals.
 Recently, in an effort to emulate the reasoning capabilities of traditional log
ical reasoners, deep learning techniques have been utilized to learn the working
 of entailment rule-based RDF(S) reasoners (see Table 2 for the rules). The first
 and foremost requirement to work with deep neural networks (DNNs) is that
 the ontology needs to be converted to a form such that it can focus more on
 the logical structure and learn the general working of the traditional reasoning
 algorithms instead of just focusing on the similarity based on the meaning or the
 textual representation. As shown in Figure 4, given a set of axioms (A ⊑ B and
 B ⊑ C), the model should be able to capture the RDFS rule involved (RDFS11
 in this case) in deriving the inference (A ⊑ C). In a deep learning context, this
 setting is similar to sequence-2-sequence machine translation models, also called
 the encoder-decoder model (similar to the sequential process used in many de

 ductive reasoning algorithms), that translate text or speech from one language
 to another. In doing so, it needs to predict the correct substitution of words
 in one language for words in another. The sentences in the input and target
 language could be of different lengths and have completely different structures.
 The difference is that for language translation, the meaning of the words needs
 to be captured. However, logical reasoning algorithms only learn an abstraction.
 For example, if we replace A with C1, C with C2, and D with C3, the reasoner
 only needs to determine that the RDFS11 rule pattern should be used here in
 order to infer C2 ⊑ C3. So, the next series of works mostly, though they differ in
 technical details, apply seq-2-seq based models to capture the functioning of the
 logical reasoners and generalize them to analogous situations or tasks.
 Fig.4. Seq2seq translator like setting of logical reasoning
 With a two-fold goal of learning RDFS rules using deep learning and demon
strating their noise-tolerance capabilities, Makni and Hendler [31] proposed a
 layered graph model for RDF where the RDF graphs were represented as a
 sequence of graph words, and the translation-based techniques were used for
 graph-to-graph learning. The proposed layered graph model is based on simple
 directed RDF graphs where each layer has its own set of directed edges. The
 f
 irst phase of encoding is to create a 3D adjacency matrix (a tensor) for the
 input graph. Each layer in the 3D adjacency matrix corresponds to the adja
cency matrix between the RDF entities linked by a single relation. These layers
 are then assigned an ID that represents their layout. The sequence of these IDs
 represents the RDF graph called “graph words”. The training set becomes a
 parallel corpus between the sequence of graph words of the input graph and the
 sequence of graph words of the inference. The algorithm then uses a seq-2-seq
 encoder-decoder architecture where the input RDF graph and its corresponding
 inference are encoded. These encoded representations are used for training. Af
ter training, the predicted inference graph is obtained for the embedded input
 test RDF graph. Finally, the inference graph is reconstructed from the translated
 embedding, and predictions are extracted. However, in this work, evaluation and
18
 Singh et al.
 training are done on the same RDF graph, that is, there is no learning of the
 general logical reasoning, and consequently, learning is not transferable to new
 domains. Hence, re-training will be needed for learning entity embeddings in the
 new ontology. They evaluated their approach on two different datasets, a syn
thetic dataset from LUBM and a real-world dataset that has been extracted from
 DBpedia. This approach can handle only noise in the ABox, and the tolerance
 to TBox noise is outside the scope of this work. In other words, it is based on the
 assumption that only assertions can potentially be noisy, and the TBox of an
 ontology cannot be noisy. Also, for training, they excluded every RDFS rule with
 only TBox axiom patterns, such as RDFS rule 5. For a similar setting, Makni et
 al. [45] proposed a method for generating justifications for the derived conclu
sions. The technique was built upon [31] and consists of a justification model,
 which is a modified seq2seq model that, while training, takes two sequences
 (encoded RDF graph and inference graph) as the input and one sequence (jus
tification) as the output. The inferred triples and the justification for each were
 generated using Apache Jena [46]. Note that the derivations provided by Jena
 are summarized derivations, so the predicted justifications are also summarized.
 Although the approach looks promising, they do not consider large and noisy
 RDFS data. In line with [31], Ebrahimi et al. [47] utilized end-2-end memory
 networks (MemN2N) [48] to emulate deductive reasoning due to the sequential
 nature of the memory networks and the attention modeling that captures only
 relevant information (logical axioms) necessary for the next reasoning step. The
 proposed approach also addresses the transferability issue by utilizing a prepro
cessing step consisting of normalization where they consistently rename all the
 entities to a predefined set of entity names. Note that the URIs which are part
 of the RDF/RDFS namespace are not renamed, so the learning is based only on
 the structural information (the type and order of constructs in each axiom) and
 not the actual names of the entities. The triples (ti) are treated as text. The
 model takes a discrete set of normalized triples t1, t2 ... tn along with a query
 q and writes them all to the memory, then calculates a continuous embedding
 for the triples and q through multiple memory accesses. Through multiple hop
 attention over these continuous representations, the model classifies the query
 with a ’yes’ or ’no’, determining whether q can be inferred from the current on
tology statements or not. The results demonstrated that a consistent renaming
 across all the ontologies in the datasets helped perform reasoning over previ
ously unseen RDFS knowledge graphs without retraining. However, there was a
 limit on the number of sampled triples. Only 1000 triples can be considered at
 a time. Furthermore, the model is query-based; that is, it does not compute all
 the inferences that may be derived from a knowledge base but provides predic
tions for single queries only. They frame the problem as a classification task, i.e.,
 check whether or not the given inference is a valid inference. Later, Ebrahimi et
 al. explored the capabilities and limitations of neural pointer networks [49] for
 the same task in a similar setting on different logics (RDF and EL+, discussed
 later in Section 3.2) and have shown significant improvements in accuracy [22].
 The model is an encoder-decoder architecture that uses attention as a pointer

 to choose an element of the input knowledge graph at each decoding time step.
 They claim that since pointer networks can generalize beyond the maximum
 lengths they were trained on, they are suitable for emulating reasoning behavior
 and show an improvement in performance by a huge margin. The core of the
 experiments comprises training a sequence-to-sequence-based model by framing
 the entailment problem as an input-output mapping task wherein they used two
 single-layer LSTMs: an LSTM encoder that converts the input sequence to a
 code that is fed to the generating network and the pointer LSTM that produces
 a vector that modulates a content-based attention mechanism over symbols in
 the input. The output of the attention mechanism is a softmax distribution with
 a dictionary size equal to the length of the input. They used two preprocessing
 steps: tokenization (splitting the text into meaningful chunks) and normalization
 (same as [47]). The proposed approach is both transferable and generative, and
 the results demonstrated improved performance compared to the state-of-the
art. However, they only consider a small dataset for their evaluation, and the
 scalability aspect hasn’t been explored yet.
 3.2 Description Logic EL
 The logical constructors supported by the description logic EL are used by sev
eral ontology developers due to their polynomial reasoning time complexity.
 Intending to further the neuro-symbolic reasoning research for more expressive
 ontologies, some recent works proposed methods to incorporate the EL con
structors and their extensions, such as existential restriction, conjunction, and
 the bottom concept (see Table 1) as embeddings.
 To incorporate the syntax and the underlying characteristics of the language
 constructs, Kulmanov et al. [50] used geometric embeddings. Geometric embed
ding techniques have gained recent attention wherein objective (loss and score)
 functions for logical axioms are constructed by transforming entities in the ontol
ogy into geometric space, as shown in Figure 5. The figure shows the projection
 of concepts, Parent and Male, of axioms Parent ⊑ Human, Male ⊑ Human and
 Parent ⊓ Male ≡ Father as spheres [50]. The intersection of the two spheres,
 Parent and Male is Father.
 Fig.5. Entities projected as geometric shapes
20
 Singh et al.
 The concepts were represented as n-balls (spheres with a fixed radius) and
 the relations as translation vectors between the centers of each concept ball.
 TransE [51] assumes that the relationship between words can be computed by
 their vector difference in the embedding space. Before constructing the embed
dings, the individuals were replaced with a single class axiom, and all the axioms
 were transformed into the standard normal form [16]. For each normal form, a
 loss function was formulated to capture the semantics of EL++. Although the
 results were promising, it did not consider the RBox and certain EL++ axioms
 that do not translate into the embedding. Further, their use case is predicting
 protein-protein interactions that are modeled as a traditional link prediction
 task in knowledge bases. To overcome the limitations, Mondal et al. [52] and
 Mohapatra et al. [53] extended this work and showed significant improvements.
 Mondal et al. [52] proposed EmEl++ by complementing the embeddings pro
posed in [50] by role-inclusions and role chains (additional constructs offered
 by EL++). While these methods provided a new technique to model the logical
 structure of axioms into the geometric space, they only considered one-to-one
 relations that prevented them from being used in more complex DLs ontologies
 such as SROIQ. To deal with it, Mohapatra et al. [53] further extended the
 work by Kulmanov et al. by modifying the embeddings to incorporate many-to
many relationships. Although effective, the n-ball embeddings have two major
 limitations. First, the intersection of two concepts can never be a ball. For ex
ample, the intersection of two concepts (balls) Parent and Male, represents the
 concept Father, which is not a ball. Therefore, the concept equivalence axiom
 Parent ⊓ Male ≡ Father cannot be captured in the embedding space. Second,
 simple translation does not allow for scaling the size. So, there are issues with
 modeling concepts of varying sizes, such as the larger concept Person can not
 be translated into a smaller concept Parent. Further, the n-ball approaches re
garded the axioms in ABoxes as special cases of TBox axioms and did not treat
 them separately. This simplification cannot fully express the logical structure of
 axioms. To overcome these limitations, Xiong et al. proposed BoxEL [54] for em
bedding EL++ ontologies. They modeled the concepts in the ontology as boxes
 (axis-aligned hyperrectangles). The intersection of two boxes is also a box. The
 individuals were encoded as points inside the (concept) boxes they should be
long to. The relations were modeled as the affine transformation between boxes
 and/or points that can capture the cases that are impossible in ball embeddings.
 Like ELEm, they designed several loss functions for each logical constructor in
 EL++ and formulated BoxEL as an optimization task. BoxEL preserves the log
ical structure and provides theoretical soundness guarantees in the sense that if
 the loss of BoxEL embedding is 0, then the trained model is a (logical) model of
 the ontology. The evaluations on three ontologies for the subsumption reasoning
 task and predicting protein-protein interactions prove that BoxEL outperformed
 previous approaches.
 The other series of works by Eberhart et al. [55] and Ebrahimi et al. [22],
 aims to emulate the behavior of traditional (deductive) reasoners. Similar to
 RDF entailment rules, EL involves reasoning rules, i.e., a sequence of applica
Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length
 21
 tions of a set of pattern-matching rules that results in the addition of a new set
 of axioms to the ontology at each step. So the goal of these works is to learn the
 working of inference-rule-based reasoners, i.e., to learn the structure of reasoning
 patterns. Although the primary goal by Eberhart et al. [55] is the ontology com
pletion wherein they predict concept inclusions and existential restrictions, this
 work aligns with the survey because of the shared objective of emulating logical
 reasoning behavior. In contrast to the other works, their approach also provides
 transparency of the derived conclusions. The approach works by mapping the
 inferences (called supports) obtained at each reasoning step in an LSTM learner.
 For reasoning, they use EL+ completion rules. This allows encoding of the input
 data in terms of ontology axioms. It also provides intermediate answers that
 might improve results when provided to the system. This logic data is fed into
 three different LSTM architectures (Deep, Piecewise, and Flat) with identical
 input and output dimensionalities. The reason for choosing three architectures
 is to compare the behavior of the systems with and without supports. The num
ber of LSTM cells is determined based on the maximum number of reasoning
 steps. The approach is able to handle noise and has shown motivating results.
 Recently, Ebrahimi et al. [22] used pointer networks (explained in Section 3.1 for
 EL+. They claim that since pointer networks can generalize beyond the max
imum lengths they were trained on, they are suitable for emulating reasoning
 behavior and show an improvement in performance by a huge margin. As dis
cussed earlier, the datasets used were very small, and hence the scalability of
 the system has not been tested.

 The previously discussed techniques work on RDF data or slightly more expres
sive ontologies such as EL, EL+, and EL++ (except [41,38], which in some sense
 also deal with RDF graphs only wherein the OWL axioms are first projected to
 RDF graphs, and word2vec is applied over the sequences generated from graph
 walk). None of the approaches handle constructs such as negation and disjunc
tion. These constructs, along with a few others, make the description logic ALC
 more expressive than the ones discussed so far. The neuro-symbolic reasoning
 work that supports ALC is limited but diverse in terms of the chosen methods,
 such as convexity [56], quantum logics [57], and learning heuristics for tableau
 optimization [58,59].
 ¨ Ozg¨ ur et al. [56] proposed to embed concepts as convex regions in vector
 spaces. The approach works in two parts– first, by constructing concepts on
 the axes-aligned cones (a class of convex cones) and then placing individuals
 on these cones. The reason behind choosing axis-aligned cones is two-fold; they
 are computationally feasible and are preserved under operators (intersection,
 polarity, and projection) that are sufficient to model constructs in the ALC
 description logics. To model unsupported constructs, set-complement, and set
union, they used a scalar product and de Morgan’s laws, respectively. Since
 an axis-aligned cone is preserved under all these ALC operators, the idea is
 that if an ontology can be projected onto an axes-aligned cone, it means that
22
 Singh et al.
 the ontology is satisfiable. The resulting embeddings can be used in concept
 membership prediction tasks. An unresolved problem in this work is whether
 roles can be interpreted by cones (or other feasible structures), and as a side
 product of defining negations by polarity, they obtain partial models. So there
 are individuals for which one does not know whether or not they belong to a
 particular concept. This is different from the approaches considered in classical
 embedding scenarios. Also, here, they only consider the case where the logic
 has been specified beforehand, not the case of investigating logic induced by the
 intersection and polarity operators for the arbitrary cones.
 Inspired by quantum space, Garg et al. [57] proposed Embed2Reason (E2R)
 that embeds an ALC ontology into a finite-dimensional vector space preserving
 the logical structure. Such an embedding, referred to as quantum embedding,
 satisfies the axioms of quantum logic [60] and allows one to perform logical
 operations (e.g., membership, negation, conjunction, disjunction, inclusion, and
 implication) directly over the vectors in a manner similar to the boolean logic ex
cept that distributive law does not hold true. E2R formulated an unconstrained
 optimization program that captures all such quantum logical (as well as regu
larity) constraints, and the program was solved using the Stochastic Gradient
 Descent (SGD) technique. The resulting embedding captured the logical input
 structure with good accuracy on complex deductive and predictive reasoning
 tasks compared to other embedding techniques.
 As discussed in Section 2.2, the performance of the tableau-based reason
ers depends a lot on the non-deterministic choices made while constructing the
 tableau. A series of works by Mehri et al. [58,61,62] focuses on selecting the right
 expansion heuristics for tableau expansion using machine learning techniques.
 The goal is not to emulate the tableau expansions but to learn the right ex
pansion heuristics for intelligent decision-making at each non-deterministic rule
 application. In one of these works [58], Mehri et al. focused on improving se
mantic branching for disjunctions and its effect on backjumping, an optimization
 technique for backtracking. Even though semantic branching avoids redundant
 search space by a great deal, machine learning techniques help to decrease re
dundant search space exploration further by learning new orders for applying
 rules at each branching level. Their results show that machine learning speeds
 up JFact by one to two orders of magnitude. Later in [61], they improved the
 ToDo list optimization technique in JFact using machine learning and applying
 it to a complex description logic that is a syntactic variant of OWL and contains
 propositional logic as a very small subset. To the best of our knowledge, this is
 the first machine-learning approach for improving such a rule-based optimization
 technique for OWL reasoners. The approach is based on an independent system
atic analysis of rule orderings to uncover ontology patterns and their associated
 features relevant to this specific optimization technique. In continuation with
 this work, Mehri et al. proposed a variation [62] wherein they learn to choose
 among the built-in expansion-ordering heuristics. These learning-derived models
 are built based on features computed and extracted from ontologies. Therefore,
 the manual fine-tuning of heuristics for these reasoners can be replaced by a new
Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length
 23
 ML-based approach implementing automatic fine-tuning of heuristics to make
 the right choice. However, the features were manually computed, and supervised
 learning techniques were applied to a set of ontologies to learn the best possi
ble expansion. Also, despite a significant amount of research there is no general
 single sorting strategy that works best for all ontology types. That’s because
 the ontologies vary in features, and hence the interaction and interplay of the
 axioms also vary. Manually designing heuristics for large and complex ontologies
 is nearly impossible. Therefore, it is important to develop a methodology that
 automatically learns to choose the most suitable expansion heuristic for each
 ontology. Inspired by the success of AlphaGo [63], researchers started explor
ing reinforcement learning (RL) for intelligent human decision-making for their
 applications. Based on a similar idea, Singh et al. [59] proposed to learn the non
deterministic expansions from scratch using deep RL such that the agent can
 learn the interaction and interplay between the axioms and make clever decisions
 whenever it has to deal with non-deterministic choices.
 3.4 OWL 2 RL
 So far, there have not been many neuro-symbolic reasoning techniques for ex
pressive ontology profiles, such as OWL 2 RL and OWL 2 DL. Hohenecker and
 Lukasiewicz [64] developed a deep learning-based model called Recursive Rea
soning Networks (RNN) for reasoning on OWL 2 RL ontologies. The approach
 deals with ABox and TBox separately (called factual information and ontology,
 respectively, in the paper). The primary goal is to train an RRN to learn the
 rules specified as part of TBox to answer queries related to the facts in the
 ABox. Since the training is relative to a particular TBox, it is independent of
 the ABox axioms it is provided with and can be used to answer queries over new
 ABox based on the same vocabulary. However, to reason over ontologies from
 new domains, the RRN needs to be retrained again. Hence the learning is not
 transferable to new domains. Since they train it on a fixed TBox, the concepts
 and relations are also fixed from the beginning, and that determines the number
 of recursive layers needed for training. For generating the embeddings, all the
 facts are first viewed as triples, where concept assertion, C(i), is denoted as (i,
 memberOf, C), and all other relation assertions, R(i,j), as (i,R,j). For negative
 samples, such as ¬C(i) and ¬R(i,j), facts are represented as (i, ¬memberOf,
 C)and (i, ¬R, j), respectively. Then, a random embedding is generated for each
 individual present in these triples. After this, the model updates the embeddings
 of the individuals by iterating over the triples. As mentioned above, the number
 of iterations required depends on the concepts and relations in the respective
 datasets. After these updates, each embedding is supposed to store the consid
ered triple and encode all the inferences that are based on the triple involved.
 So, intuitively, a single update step conducts local reasoning based on the em
beddings and the new information gained through the provided fact. Since the
 model goes through all the facts multiple times in several iterations, it allows
 for multi-hop reasoning. After training, predictions are made based on the ob
tained embeddings of all individuals. The reported results show good accuracy.
24
 Singh et al.
 However, since the updates are made in multiple steps, the method does not
 have the provision of generating justifications or transparency for the predicted
 inferences. In RRNs, triples are not treated as text, instead, the individuals that
 appear in a triple are mapped to their embeddings before providing the same to
 any layers of the used model. However, this means that RRNs are independent of
 the individual names used in a database, which makes perfect sense, as it is only
 the structure of a knowledge base that determines possible inferences. A point
 of difference from the other approaches [31,47] is that the RRN is trained on a
 f
 ixed ontology, i.e., the vocabulary of concepts and relations is predetermined.
 The model does not learn the logical structure of the axioms; hence, the learning
 is not transferable to different domains. The performance is evaluated based on
 the query predictions. Hence the approach is not generative.
 3.5 Summary
 This section gives an overview of the neuro-symbolic reasoning techniques dis
cussed so far from two different perspectives. In Table 4, we categorize the ex
isting works based on the technique. Although the technical details differ, the
 works can be grouped based on the high-level idea used. For each work, we give
 a one-line summary along with the reasoning task handled. In Table 5, inspired
 by Ebrahimi et al. [22], we highlight the key differences between the learned
 models in terms of the essential features that can potentially provide pointers
 for further research in this direction. The transfer column indicates whether the
 system can adapt to ontologies in the new domain by making use of its learned
 model from other domains. The transparency column indicates whether the pre
dictions and the drawn inferences are explainable. The scale column indicates
 the size of input ontologies that were used for evaluations, ranging from a few
 logical statements (up to 1,000 triples) [22,47] to very large (say, up to 1 million).
 The performance column indicates the accuracy of the system on the reasoning
 task; “high” indicates 70% or more, while “low” indicates values slightly better
 than random guessing. Although these measures are subjective and there is no
 common platform where all the systems can be run together and compared on
 similar datasets, the goal here is just to summarize the existing neuro-symbolic
 reasoning techniques based on the results reported in terms of their important
 features.

 One way to bridge this gap and foster a strong research community is to hold
 challenges. This could further help the new ontology and system developers to
 check the hardness of the ontologies and find the performance bottlenecks of
 their systems. With this aim and inspired by ORE [65], two editions of the Se
mantic Reasoning Evaluation Challenge (SemREC)12 were held so far. In the
 f
 irst edition of SemREC13 [66], co-located with the 20th International Semantic
 Web Conference (ISWC 202114), submissions were invited across three tracks.
 In the first track, ontologies that challenge the reasoners can be submitted. The
 second and third track is for RDFS and description logic reasoners that make use
 of traditional and neuro-symbolic techniques, respectively. The second edition of
 SemREC was co-located with the 21st International Semantic Web Conference
 (ISWC 202215). Since the research in conventional reasoning optimization has

 29
 stagnated, in the second edition of SemREC, the second track from the first
 edition was dropped. The track on neuro-symbolic reasoning systems has been
 expanded to include multi-hop reasoners and inductive reasoning techniques.
 Across the two editions, there were three submissions related to neuro-symbolic
 reasoning [67,68,69]. The system submitted by Mohapatra et al. [67] is the same
 as [53] that was discussed in section 3. They provided an effective way to capture
 the many-to-many relations between the concepts and built on top of [50,52].
 Chowdhury et al. [68] used an end-to-end Memory Network (MemN2N) [48]
 with attention that captures the most relevant information to conduct logical
 reasoning. Mehryar et al. [69] submitted aTransE, an extension of TransE and
 rTransE to make subsumption and instance checking reasoning possible, whereby
 reasoning can take place in the vector space by leveraging transitive relations.
 They further improved the quality of embeddings using reinforcement learning,
 where they generated multi-hop samples using a policy network. The agent is a
 neural network that takes as input an entity vector embedding (i.e., state) and
 outputs a relationship (i.e., action). The use of RL helped find more meaning
ful and longer sequences of translations. All the submissions were evaluated on
 ontologies from different sources such as the ORE benchmark framework [65],
 OWL2Bench [8], and CaLiGraph [70]. The ORE benchmark framework16 is an
 open-source java-based framework that was a part of the OWL Reasoner Evalu
ation (ORE) Competition. The competition evaluated the performance of OWL
 2 complaint reasoners over several different OWL 2 EL and OWL 2 DL on
tologies. But, the performance evaluation in the context of varying sizes of an
 ontology was not considered. The ORE competition corpus can be used with
 the framework for reasoner evaluation. The framework evaluates the reasoners
 on three reasoning tasks– consistency checking, classification, and realization.
 The framework does not include the evaluation of the SPARQL query engines
 (with OWLreasoning support) with respect to the coverage of OWL 2 constructs
 and scalability. OWL2Bench, on the other hand, tests the OWL 2 reasoners in
 terms of their coverage, scalability, and query performance. It is an extension
 of the well-known University Ontology Benchmark (UOBM) [71]. OWL2Bench
 consists of the following– TBox axioms for each of the four OWL 2 profiles (EL,
 QL, RL, and DL), a synthetic ABox axiom generator that can generate axioms
 of arbitrary size, and a set of SPARQL queries that involve reasoning over the
 OWL 2 language constructs. CaLiGraph ontologies were the winners of task 1
 (challenging ontology submission) of SemREC 2021. CaLiGraph is a large-scale
 cross-domain knowledge graph generated from Wikipedia by exploiting the cat
egory system, list pages, and other list structures in Wikipedia, containing more
 than 15 million typed entities and around 10 million relation assertions. Other
 than the knowledge graphs such as DBpedia [72] and YAGO [73], whose ontolo
gies are comparably simplistic, CaLiGraph has a rich ontology comprising more
 than 200,000 class restrictions. Those two properties, a large ABox and a rich
 ontology, make it an interesting challenge for benchmarking reasoners. Since all
 the submissions to the neuro-symbolic reasoner track in the second edition of
 16 https://github.com/ykazakov/ore-2015-competition-framework
30
 Singh et al.
 SemREC belonged to a different category with respect to the task on which the
 system was evaluated on, it was not possible to compare them. For instance,
 Sulogna et al. [68] submitted a system that supports the transfer property. The
 evaluation was performed on a query-based task, where they obtained good re
sults on the CaliGraph dataset without retraining. But their system supports
 only RDFS axioms, and there was a limit on the number of axioms (1000 triples)
 used for training. For that, they randomly divided each ontology into multiple
 datasets of 1000 triples each. The other submission by Shervin et al. [69] was
 designed for the link prediction task (subclass and type of relations), and the
 metric used was Hits@n.
 The growth of neuro-symbolic and conventional ontology reasoners largely
 depends on the datasets that are available for evaluating them. Most reasoner
 evaluations are performed on a subset of several thousands of ontologies that
 are available across repositories such as the DBpedia [72], YAGO [73], Wiki
data [74], Claros17, NCBO Bioportal18, and AgroPortal19. However, such an
 approach is inflexible as most ontologies involve only a limited set of OWL con
structs and arbitrarily large and complex ontologies are seldom available that
 can be used to test the limits of systems being benchmarked. Similarly, existing
 synthetic benchmarks, such as LUBM [75], UOBM [71], OntoBench [76], ORE,
 and OWL2Bench, also do not have the flexibility to generate ontologies that
 vary in terms of TBox size and language constructs. To evaluate the reasoners,
 it is important to have a benchmark that can generate ontologies depending
 on the task at hand. For example, if the performance of a neuro-symbolic rea
soner needs to be evaluated or compared with another reasoner on the concept
 subsumption task for EL++ ontologies, we need to have a benchmark that can
 generate a large number of ontologies that vary in size with respect to different
 OWL constructs. [77], an extension of OWL2Bench describes an ongoing effort
 towards building such a customizable ontology benchmark for OWL 2 reasoners.
 5 Conclusion
 In this chapter, we gave an overview of the neuro-symbolic reasoning techniques
 over RDF and description logic ontologies. We now answer the research questions
 posed in Section 3. Although the body of published work (Table 4 and Table 5) is
 relatively small, it is obvious from the results that deductive reasoning is a very
 hard task for deep learning with increasing hardness, especially for more complex
 logic and scalability issues. It can be observed that, under certain provisions, even
 the best reasoning models based on machine learning are still not in a position
 to compete with their symbolic counterparts. To an extent, it has been shown
 that the developed neuro-symbolic techniques are noise-resistant, but they need
 negative samples to be added to the datasets, which is mostly done manually

 or randomly. Despite all the efforts, existing neuro-symbolic reasoners are still
 unable to do the following.– Perform full reasoning over expressive ontologies such as OWL 2 DL. The ex
isting methods have limitations in learning complex ontology axioms. Most
 techniques used simpler and less expressive ontology profiles. However, in
terestingly, the body of work indicates the potential and feasibility of deep
 learning techniques for reasoning over more expressive ontologies.– Perform reasoning over new ontologies (domain-independent reasoning) with
 high precision and recall. Although some techniques support the transfer
 property, the method used was based on the consistent renaming of all the
 entities in the ontologies (each entity is assigned a unique numeric identi
f
 ier). But this does not solve the out-of-vocabulary issue because the highest
 number assigned to an entity depends on the size of the largest ontology
 used for training. The size of the test ontology could never be larger than
 that. However, the initial results are interesting and highly motivating for
 further work in that direction.
 Amajor aspect that the researchers in the domain have probably overlooked
 is the unavailability of the datasets and a common evaluation framework. Clearly,
 all the techniques discussed indicate the scope for research and improvements in
 this direction. It would have been great if all the published or yet-to-be-published
 works could have been trained and tested on the same datasets using the same
 resources. From the results reported in the summary table, if the scalability and
 performance are high, without any transfer, then the approach is clearly un
suitable for the deductive reasoning goal. On the other hand, some techniques
 support the transfer property but fail to consider the dataset variety (varying
 language constructs and dataset sizes). In order to make progress, firstly, it is
 very important to incorporate the datasets in evaluations that vary in terms
 of several parameters, and these datasets should become the standard for the
 neuro-symbolic reasoning systems. Secondly, automatic learning should be incor
porated. Recently, reinforcement learning for FOL [78] has shown tremendous
 improvements where the systems learn to perform reasoning from scratch. For
 instance, in the case of reasoners that use inference-rule based methods, instead
 of providing the inferences (output) beforehand and then mapping the input and
 the output sequences using seq-2-seq translators, an RL agent can be provided
 with all the ontology axioms, along with the inference rules. The RL agent can
 then start randomly applying the inference rules on the given set of axioms. The
 rewards can be designed so that the agent learns to reach the desired conclusion
 in the least number of steps. Learning from scratch has an added advantage over
 labeled/supervised methods, where neural networks learn by exploring several
 possible moves that could lead to either right or wrong decisions (human-like
 learning). Something similar can also be explored for the tableau based rea
soners. Extending the architectures discussed here with learning from scratch
 would enable transparency and explanation generation alongside the computed
 predictions.

### Chapter 1: Introduction

Chapter 12 provides additional details about the symbols in this document. It covers topics such as variations in the height of certain mathematical symbols, non-unique symbol names across packages, creating new symbols from existing ones, spacing of symbols in math mode, boldfacing schemes for symbols, LATEX ASCII and Latin-1 tables, Unicode input/output, and information about this document itself. The document concludes with an index of all symbols and other useful terms.

A companion document, **Raw Font Tables**, presents symbols in a different structure. While this document categorizes symbols, Raw Font Tables organizes them by font file. It includes symbols produced via font files but excludes composite symbols and symbols drawn as pictures (e.g., using TikZ). Raw Font Tables is useful for identifying related symbols, finding overlooked symbols, and determining font names and character positions for isolated symbol typesetting. This is particularly important for math symbols, as TEX limits math alphabets to 16 per document. Symbols typeset with `\font` and `\char` do not consume a math alphabet but are less convenient for mathematical expressions.

### Frequently Requested Symbols

Below is a list of commonly requested symbols to help you locate them quickly:

- **Accented Characters**: ¯ı, ˜ı, ˝ı, ˘ı, ˇı, etc. (versus ¯i, ˜i, ˝i, ˘i, ˇi)
- **Currency Symbols**: ¢
- **Mathematical Symbols**: ∴, ≲, ≳
- **Special Characters**: ©, ®, ™, ‰
- **Temperature and Angles**: ° (e.g., “180°” or “15℃”)
- **Accents**: ¯a, `ˆe, etc. (multiple accents per character)
- **Comparison Operators**: <, >, | (instead of ¡, ¿, —)
- **Miscellaneous**: ˆ, ˜ (or ∼)

| A ˜    | \ut{A}               |
| a ˜    | \ut{a}               |

> **Note:** The `phonetic` package provides additional macros for linguistic accents. For example:
> - `\acbar{\’}{a}` → “´ ¯ a”
> - `\acarc{\"}{e}` → “¨ { e”
> - `\labvel{mn}` → “⌢ mn”
> - `\upbar` places a bar between characters, e.g., `x\upbar{}y` → “xy”.
> - `\uplett` behaves like `\textsuperscript` but uses a smaller font.

### Table 26: arcs Text-mode Accents

| Symbol | Command               |
|--------|-----------------------|
| A ⌢    | \overarc{A}          |

| A ⌣    | \underarc{A}         |
| a ⌣    | \underarc{a}         |
> **Note:** The accents scale to a few characters wide. An optional macro argument can adjust the width of the accented characters. See the `arcs` documentation for more details.  
At the time of this writing (2015/11/12), there exists an incompatibility between the `arcs` package and the `relsize` package, upon which `arcs` depends. As a workaround, one should apply the patch proposed by Michael Sharpe on the XeTeX mailing list (Subject: “The arcs package”, dated 2013/08/25) to prevent spurious text from being added to the document (e.g., “5.0ptA” when “A ⌢” is expected).

### Table 27: `semtrans` Accents

| Symbol | Command       |
|--------|---------------|
| A ¨    | \D{A}         |

| Symbol | Command       |
|--------|---------------|
| A ,    | \cb{A}        |
| a ,    | \cb{a}        |

> **Note:** `\cb` places a comma above letters with descenders. For example, `\cb{s}` produces “s ,”, while `\cb{g}` produces “g ‘”.

| i      | \secstress    |
| y      | \underring    |
| |      | \undertilde   |

> **Note:** The `wsuipa` package defines all of the above as ordinary characters, not as accents. However, it provides `\diatop` and `\diaunder` commands to compose diacritics with other characters. For example, `\diatop[\overring|a]` produces “x a”, and `\diaunder[\underdots|a]` produces “r a”.

### Mathematical Symbols

Most symbols in this chapter are math-mode only, meaning they must be used within `$...$`, `\[...\]`, or another math-mode environment. Operators marked as "variable-sized" adjust their size depending on the context (e.g., displayed formulas, in-text formulas, or subscripts/superscripts).

#### Table 49: Math-mode Versions of Text Symbols

| Symbol | Command               |
|--------|-----------------------|
| $      | \mathdollar          |

#### Example Usage

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{upint}

\begin{document}

Here are examples of upright and slanted integrals:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Upright: $\intup$, $\iintup$, $\ointup$
  \item Slanted: $\intsl$, $\iintsl$, $\ointsl$
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

#### Table 96: `pdfMsym` Extensible Math Operators

| Symbol | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Y      | `\prood` | Extends horizontally to fit limits. |
| X      | `\suum`  | Extends horizontally to fit limits. |

Example usage:

```latex
\suum_{i=\lfloor\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\rfloor}^{\max(5N-3, 11N-8)}
```

This produces:

\[
\sum_{i=\lfloor\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\rfloor}^{\max(5N-3, 11N-8)}
\]

> **Note:** `pdfMsym` symbols are implemented with PDF literals and are compatible with `pdfLaTeX` and `LuaLaTeX`. Some symbols work with `XeLaTeX`, but not with other TeX backends.

 Symbolic Knowledge Structures and Intuitive
 Knowledge Structures

 Abstract
 This paper proposes that two distinct types of structures are present
 in the brain: Symbolic Knowledge Structures (SKSs), used for formal sym
bolic reasoning, and Intuitive Knowledge Structures (IKSs), used for draw
ing informal associations. The paper contains ideas for modeling and an
alyzing these structures in an algorithmic style based on Spiking Neural
 Networks, following the paradigm of [9, 14, 5, 7]. The paper also con
tains two examples of use of these structures, involving counting through
 a memorized sequence, and understanding simple stylized sentences.
 Disclaimer: The ideas presented here are preliminary and speculative,
 and do not (yet) comprise a complete, coherent, algorithmic theory. That
 will require more thought and work. I hope that posting this preliminary
 version will help the ideas to evolve into such a theory.
 1 Introduction
 This work was originally motivated by trying to understand how language is
 processed in the human brain. Over time, the work has evolved so that now it
 focuses on two separate kinds of structures in the brain: one representing sym
bolic knowledge and one representing intuitive knowledge. An intuitive knowl
edge structure represents informally-understood concepts. It supports construc
tion of new concepts and relationships, as well as drawing informal associations
 between concepts, so that thoughts about some concepts may trigger thoughts
 about others. A symbolic knowledge structure, on the other hand, represents
 symbols (numbers, words, parts of speech, etc.), and supports formal, logical
 reasoning.
 ∗This work was supported by the National Science Foundation awards CCF-1810758 and
 CCF-2139936.
 1
These two types of structures, symbolic and intuitive, are used in language
 processing. A symbolic knowledge structure includes precise representations of
 linguistic elements such as words and parts of speech. It also encodes formal
 structures such as parse trees, and other relationships between linguistic ele
ments. An intuitive knowledge structure includes imprecise representations of
 concepts that are denoted by words and sentences, such as pictures and simple
 stories. It also encodes informally-understood relationships between concepts.
 However, language processing isn’t the only use for these structures. In an
 example I develop in this paper, one might memorize a sequence of symbols,
 each of which corresponds to some elaborate concept; for example, the successive
 letters in the Greek alphabet might be used to name the successive variants of
 an aggressive virus, or successive hurricanes in a particular year. Associated
 with each Greek letter is a collection of information about the virus variant or
 hurricane, which can be informally understood. The Greek names would appear
 in a symbolic knowledge structure, whereas the information about the virus or
 hurricane would appear in an intuitive knowledge structure.
 Yet another example might arise in planning a plumbing system, or other
 construction project. The plumbing system designer knows intuitively that wa
ter should flow in a pipe at approximately a certain natural rate—knowledge
 that lives in an intuitive knowledge structure. The designer must translate that
 intuitive requirement into precise angles at which to place the pipes; this part
 requires mathematical (symbolic) calculation, in a symbolic knowledge struc
ture.
 Myapproach in this paper is in terms of abstract models and algorithms, not
 in terms of actual areas of the human brain. This is the approach my co-workers
 and I have taken previously, in studying such problems as Winner-Take-All
 selection [9, 14], neural coding of complex data [5], and recognition and learning
 of hierarchical concepts [7]. It would be nice to (eventually) relate these abstract
 structures to brain areas. It seems plausible that the two kinds of structures
 considered here might reside in different areas of the brain, containing neurons
 with different characteristics. For example, a symbolic knowledge structure
 should be implemented using neurons that arereliable, with reliable connections.
 An intuitive knowledge structure could be built using less reliable neurons, with
 noisy connections.
 This division into symbolic knowledge structures and intuitive knowledge
 structures should be useful in understanding the differences between the intelli
gence of humans and other animals. Basically, both humans and many animals
 utilize intuitive knowledge and computation to understand their world and plan
 their activities. Humans also make extensive use of symbolic knowledge and
 computation.
 2 Model for Symbolic and Intuitive Knowledge
 This section contains a description of the proposed model. The following sec
tions, Sections 3-5, contain examples.
 2
The representation I envision for a set of related concepts consists of three
 main parts: an Intuitive Knowledge Structure (IKS), which stores intuitive con
cepts and their informal relationships, a Lexicon that stores symbols and some of
 their basic attributes, and a Symbolic Knowledge Structure (SKS), which stores
 symbols and their formal relationships. The SKS connects to the Lexicon and
 the IKS. Also, both the SKS and the IKS connect to input and output facilities,
 via special input and output neurons.
 In addition, I assume that we have a limited amount of Working Memory,
 consisting of neurons that can “point to” certain particular symbols or intuitive
 concepts that the brain is currently focusing on. These Working Memory neu
rons may represent special “roles” being played by the symbols or concepts, such
 as the “current number” in a series of numbers, a partial result in a calculation,
 or the subject in a sentence.
 The IKS contains entities (neurons, or collections of neurons) that represent
 intuitive concepts. Reasoning using the IKS is intuitive reasoning, which I might
 not even call “reasoning”—it is more like just following associations. The SKS
 contains entities that represent symbols. Reasoning using the SKS is logical,
 rather precise reasoning.
 I believe that the IKS is present in nearly all animals, not just humans. The
 Lexicon and the SKS, however, seem to be mostly characteristic of humans.
 Some research indicates that some apes may have rudimentary versions of these
 two structures, allowing them to process some symbols and perhaps perform
 some elementary symbolic manipulations (for example, see [11]). But in general,
 these structures are reserved for humans.
 In the rest of this section, I sketch how we might model the various compo
nents formally. My starting point is the synchronous, stochastic Spiking Neural
 Network (SNN) model of Lynch and Musco [8]. I expect that we will need
 to augment this model to include recent history, learning readiness, and other
 features.
 2.1 The Intuitive Knowledge Structure
 I begin by describing the Intuitive Knowledge Structure. In overview, the IKS
 consists of a collection of “concept neurons” and some directed connections
 between them. The neurons and the connections may be unreliable.
 It seems natural to model the IKS at two different levels of abstraction, where
 we think of the lower level as “implementing” the higher level. The higher level
 consists of individual neurons, with a single neuron representing each concept.
 Some pairs of neurons are connected by directed edges. The lower level may
 allow multiple neurons for the same concept. The use of multiple neurons may
 provide redundancy and increase reliability—so a lower-level model based on
 less reliable neurons can “implement” a higher-level model with more reliable
 neurons. I consider the question of whether the sets of neurons for different
 concepts can overlap, below.
 3
Higher-level model: Thehigher-levelmodel for the IKSis based ona weighted
 directed graph whose nodes correspond to concept neurons. This graph serves
 as the basis for a neural network model, similar to the one in [8]: at each round,
 each neuron exhibits firing behavior based on its total incoming potential, as
 described in [8]. This incoming potential is the sum of the weights of the in
coming edges from currently-firing incoming neighbors. The graph is dynamic:
 it may change over time as concepts get learned, get seen together, get seen in
 apparent causal relationships, and so on.
 This IKS model may include some unreliability, both in neurons and in
 connections. To model unreliability in the neurons, note that the sigmoid func
tion that is used in translating incoming potential to firing probability (see [8])
 yields stochastic behavior; shallower sigmoid functions yield more uncertainty.
 We might also associate a failure probability with each neuron; failure of a neu
ron might mean that it doesn’t fire even if its incoming potential indicates that
 it should, or fires even if it is not supposed to. To model unreliability in connec
tions, we might introduce a probability distribution for the potential conveyed
 on each edge, rather than using a fixed value. We might also associate a failure
 probability with each edge; failure of an edge might mean that it doesn’t con
vey potential, or conveys a different potential from what it should. We might
 consider other failure modes, temporary or permanent.
 I imagine that the IKS is constructed using operations like those presented
 by Valiant [15], and Papadimitriou and Vempals [3], notably the Join operation,
 also known as Merge. In this work, performing a Join/Merge involves creating
 an entirely new concept that is built from other concepts, that is, a hierarchical
 concept. Another operation is Associate, also known as Link. These operations
 can be used to construct the IKS, and help to determine its structure. Other
 structural relationships that might appear in the IKS include causality and
 temporal predictions.
 For some purposes, we will probably want additional structure in the IKS,
 besides just neurons and directed edges. For example, we might want to include
 the information that one concept neuron is a “child” of another concept neuron.
 That is, we might classify some of the directed edges as parent edges or child
 edges, as in [7]. For a sequence, we might have successor edges and predecessor
 edges. For a sentence, we might have subject edges and predicate edges. Other
 labels might be appropriate for other kinds of relationships. We also might want
 multiple edges, with different labels, between the same pairs of neurons. Thus,
 in general, our model will be not just a weighted directed graph, but a labeled,
 weighted, directed multigraph.
 Whatever type of graph we use, we will need to develop a Spiking Neural
 Network model based on it. This will require extending the model of [8].1
 We can consider several general kinds of operations to be performed on the
 IKS, with varying latencies.
 1It is straightforward to extend that model to include multiple edges. For edge labels, we
 may need other machinery. For example, we might want to have external signals that turn all
 edges with certain labels on, or turn them all off.
 4
1. Direct recognition of concepts: When an input is presented for one of
 the concepts in the IKS (in whatever form we allow for inputs, see Sec
tion 2.4), it can cause a particular neuron, or neurons, to fire. This should
 happen very fast, in milliseconds. This might also trigger some outputs
 (in whatever form we allow for outputs, see Section 2.4).
 This kind of operation corresponds to recognizing something directly, and
 responding in some automatic way. This is “fast thinking”, in Kahneman’s
 terminology [6].
 2. Indirect recognition of concepts: An input is presented, but instead of
 causing immediate recognition, it triggers a cascade of neurons firing. This
 might result in an output. This overall process should still be fast, because
 each link is fast, as long as we are not talking about too long a chain of
 links.
 This corresponds to producing a collection of associations for the input
 concept. Probably this is still “fast thinking”, in Kahneman’s sense, since
 it is automatic, and each step of the cascade is very fast.
 The behavior the network exhibits in such a cascade is as follows: Input
 of some sort arrives, triggering some particular concept neurons to fire.
 These cause potential to flow to their outgoing neighbor concept neurons.
 If these receive enough potential, they fire with some probability, based on
 their sigmoid firing function (and possibly other uncertainty). Thus, the
 effect of inputs is somewhat unpredictable, based on how this uncertainty
 is resolved. The overall result from the input is a somewhat unpredictable
 cascade of firing of related concepts.
 3. Learning of concepts or relationships: Some concept or relationship inputs
 are presented, causing new concepts or new relationships to be learned.
 Also, already-learned concepts and relationships could have their repre
sentations strengthened when they are presented again.
 Learning a new concept should involve associating the new concept with
 an unused internal neuron, plus strengthening the weights of edges that
 connect the input neurons encoding the concept to the internal repre
senting neuron. This process might use a Winner-Take-All mechanism to
 select a suitable unused neuron, as in [7]. Reinforcing a concept might
 involve strengthening these edge weights.
 Learning a new relationship between two concepts, or strengthening an
 existing relationship, should involve increasing the weights of edges that
 connect the concepts to each other.
 These learning operations should be fairly slow—seconds, or minutes.
 They use some form of Hebbian learning, such as Oja’s rule [10].
 So far, the structure and behavior of this model appear to correspond well
 to Valiant’s work [15].
 5
What about outputs? Among the concept neurons in the IKS, we can iden
tify some as output neurons, which represent certain decisions. For example,
 the decision may be an evaluation of a situation as “good”, “neutral”, “bad”,
 or “terrible”. These neurons can also trigger emotional responses, like “happy”,
 “sad”, “scared”, or “angry”, probably by activating other neurons outside the
 IKS.
 It should be possible to prove some simple theoretical latency bounds for
 the various kinds of operations on the IKS. The recognition operations should
 be analyzed in terms of parameters representing time for a single round of
 execution, that is, for one step in the synchronous Lynch-Musco model, and the
 depth of a cascade of firing. The learning time would depend on the time for a
 single round of execution, and on the particular learning rule that is used. For
 example, Lynch and Mallmann-Trenn [7] analyzed the time required to learn a
 hierarchical concept, using a particular Oja-style learning rule.
 Lower-level model: The lower-level graph is defined as a redundant version
 of a given higher-level graph. Each concept c represented in the higher-level
 graph has some number m of neurons in the lower-level graph; to make things
 simple here, we assume the same number m of neurons for every concept. The
 edges are replicated, connecting every neuron representing one concept c1 to
 every neuron representing another concept c2 if and only if the unique repre
senting neurons for c1 and c2 are connected in the higher-level graph.2 As for
 the higher-level model, this model may be dynamic, and may include some un
reliability. As before, we will want to allow multi-edges and labels, and we will
 need a neural network model based on this graph model.
 The lower-level model supports the same kinds of operations as the higher
level model. The direct and indirect recognition operations should work in
 essentially the same way as before, except that now the inputs will trigger
 multiple representing neurons to fire, propagation of firing will involve all the
 replicas, and the final output neurons will receive their potential from multiple
 internal neurons. The learning operations will also involve replication, in that
 the same learning rule will be applied on all the edges that correspond to a
 single higher-level edge. However, since the behavior of each individual neuron
 is stochastic, the behavior of the different replicas for the same concept will tend
 to diverge as the cascade proceeds.
 An intriguing question is whether we should allow the sets of neurons repre
senting different concepts to overlap. Valiant, and Papadimitriou and Vempala,
 allow such overlap; in particular, Papadimitriou and Vempala analyze overlap in
 detail, in their work on computing with assemblies of neurons [3]. Based on their
 simulations, Papadimitriou and Vempala observe that the set of neurons that
 represent a particular concept may shift over time, in response to presentations
 of the concept in relationship with other concepts.
 An alternative hypothesis that seems consistent with the results in [3] is
 that the set of representing neurons for each concept c is fixed, and does not
 2This could be weakened to allow somewhat less connectivity.
 6
change over time. However, instead of observing the firing of a large set of
 representing neurons for a concept c that shifts over time, we might observe the
 f
 iring of a large set of neurons that participate in a multi-step firing cascade,
 initiated by the firing of a smaller, fixed set of actual representing neurons for
 c. When two concepts are presented together, the connections between them
 strengthen, because of Hebbian learning. Then afterwards, presentation of one
 of the concepts is likely to trigger firing of the representing neurons of the
 other, as part of a firing cascade. This might make it look like c has a larger,
 changing set of representing neurons, whereas actually, it has a smaller, fixed
 set of neurons, with changing edge weights.
 Relationship between the two levels: The low-level model adds redun
dancy to the high-level model, but otherwise operates similarly. The key differ
ence should be an increase in reliability, where many less-reliable neurons and
 edges at the lower level can be used to simulate more-reliable neurons and edges
 at the higher level. This should lead to increased overall reliability.
 Once we have formal definitions of both the higher-level and lower-level
 models, we should describe a formal correspondence between the two system
 models and use it to prove that the less-reliable lower-level IKS model cor
rectly simulates the more-reliable higher-level model. The correspondence will
 define formal relationships between the states of the two system models, and
 between their transitions. Since the systems are probabilistic, we would need to
 consider simulations specifically designed for probabilistic systems, such as the
 ones studied by Canetti, Cheung, et al. [2], and Lynch and Segala [13].
 2.2 The Lexicon
 The Lexicon stores symbols, along with some associated attributes, in a way
 that supports fast random access. “Random access” here simply means that
 the firing of certain external neurons directly triggers the firing of neurons in
 the Lexicon, with no complex access mechanism involved. A substantial Lexicon
 seems to be characteristic of humans, and does not seem to be present in other
 animals.
 Formally, the Lexicon contains one (or perhaps a small number) of neurons
 for each symbol that it stores. Input encoding a symbol is presented somehow,
 from outside the Lexicon, and triggers firing of the corresponding neurons in the
 Lexicon. This input may come from several possible sources: the outside world
 through vision, listening, or reading; corresponding symbol neurons in the SKS;
 or corresponding informal concept neurons in the IKS. It is also plausible that
 the input from the outside world might not trigger the neurons in the Lexicon
 directly, but just indirectly, though symbol neurons in the SKS or IKS; these
 interactions remain to be defined.
 In the human brain, I assume the Lexicon could be implemented in the
 neocortex. This is consistent with the fact that humans have large and highly
 developed neocortexes, and also can store a very large number of symbols. Also,
 7
the neocortex has a fairly uniform structure, which is consistent with the needs
 of a large random-access store.
 2.3 The Symbolic Knowledge Structure
 The symbolic knowledge structure (SKS) consists of a collection of “symbol
 neurons” and some directed connections between them. The neurons and con
nections should be more reliable than those in the IKS. Reliability for neurons
 may mean sharp thresholds (or at least, extremely steep sigmoid functions),
 plus no other types of failures. Reliability for connections means that poten
tial is conveyed accurately. As for the IKS, we model the SKS at two levels of
 abstraction.
 Higher-level model: Abstractly, the SKS is another labeled, weighted, di
rected multigraph. The nodes of this digraph are “symbol neurons”, which are
 separate from the corresponding symbol neurons in the Lexicon. There are reli
able edges between the corresponding symbol neurons in the SKS and Lexicon,
 in both directions. The graph is dynamic, changing in response to presentation
 of new concepts and combinations of concepts.
 The SKS can be constructed using operations like those used for the IKS,
 such as Join/Merge and Associate/Link. However, more interesting special-case
 structures (such as sequences, parse trees, mathematical proofs,...) can also be
 built in the SKS, under purposeful control from the outside. This may use
 Working Memory.
 The SKS is also connected to input mechanisms (visual, auditory) and out
put mechanisms. Each symbol neuron can be triggered by symbolic inputs, like
 hearing a particular word spoken. Likewise, the neuron can trigger symbolic
 outputs, like saying the word. Another important input/output mechanism for
 symbols involves reading and writing. Reading and writing differ from speech
 input/output in that they have the pleasant effect of expanding the SKS, in
creasing its size by utilizing paper or computer storage. Thus, humans can
 write down a long list of items, or a complicated math proof, or a very large
 parse tree. These symbolic structures can be much larger than what humans
 can remember, or manipulate, in their internal SKS structures.3
 Furthermore, and crucially, the SKS is directly connected to the IKS. Specif
ically, each symbol neuron in the SKS connects to one or more related concept
 neurons in the IKS. There should be a strong and reliable connection from each
 symbol neuron to each of its corresponding intuitive concept neurons, and vice
 versa.4
 3Another example of expanding the SKS is the process of “counting on our fingers”. Mostly
 everyone over the age of five knows a correspondence between our fingers and the numbers
 one through ten, and can use that for counting items in the real world. We can also use our
 f
 ingers to help us count symbols in a sequence that is memorized in the SKS.
 4It seems clear that humans can generally move quickly from a symbol neuron to any of
 its corresponding intuitive concept neurons. The reverse is also usually true, but there are
 exceptions—when you just can’t think of the name for some concept that you “know”!
 8
Again, we can consider several kinds of operations to be performed on the
 SKS, with different latencies:
 1. Direct recognition of symbols: As for the IKS, when an input is presented
 for one of the symbols in the SKS, it causes a particular neuron, or neurons,
 to fire. As for the IKS, this should happen very fast, in milliseconds. This
 might also trigger symbolic outputs. In addition, the firing of a symbol
 neuron in the SKS will trigger firing of the corresponding neuron in the
 Lexicon.
 As before, this corresponds to recognizing a symbol quickly and directly,
 and perhaps responding in some automatic way. As for the IKS, this part
 of the usage of the SKS corresponds to Kahneman’s fast thinking. An
 example here is direct translation, such as hearing a spoken word and
 outputting a written version.
 2. Multistep symbolic computation: An input is presented, and it triggers
 some type of symbolic computation in the SKS. For example, a number k
 may be input, and the number k +2 should be output. Or two numbers
 may be input and their sum should be output. Another example, which
 I will explore in Sections 3 and 4, involves inputting a number k and
 outputting the kth element in a sequence that is memorized within the
 SKS.
 Another example, which I will discuss in Section 5, involves inputting a
 stream of words, and having the SKS determine whether or not the words
 form a syntactically correct sentence having a predetermined simple struc
ture, say, a noun (the subject), followed by a transitive verb, followed by
 another noun (the object). The SKS might also output a representation
 of the sentence structure, such as a parse tree. More generally, the SKS
 might determine whether the sentence fits any of a predetermined finite
 set of sentence structures, or fits any correct sentence structure. Other ex
amples of multistep symbolic computation might include solving algebraic
 equations.
 The latency required for such operations varies, of course. For recognizing
 simple sentences, the response should be very fast: people parse simple
 sentences almost immediately after the input has been fully presented. But
 processing even a simple sentence isn’t trivial: it requires finding the words
 in the SKS and the Lexicon, and fitting them into some representation of
 the sentence structure, such as a parse tree. Doing all of this fast might
 require that the sentence structure be built into the SKS ahead of time, so
 that what remains to be done is just fitting the arriving words into their
 proper places. For more complicated sentences, time is also required for
 determining the sentence structure.
 Counting, or more elaborate arithmetic calculations, will give a slower re
sponse, on the order of seconds. These require multi-step calculations, and
 following paths in the SKS. They also require attention, and purposeful
 9
focus on particular parts of the computation. This focus will involve the
 use of Working Memory (see below), and perhaps some form of Winner
Take-All mechanism [9]. This type of computation should correspond to
 Kahneman’s slow thinking.
 All of these multi-step computations in the IKS should be precise and
 reliable, in contrast to multi-step computations in the IKS.
 3. Computation involving both the SKS and the IKS: The simplest case in
volves computation in the SKS, followed by triggering of neurons in the
 IKS and cascades of firing in the IKS. Our examples in Sections 3-5 are
 all of this type. More complicated cases would involve more elaborate
 interactions between the SKS and IKS.
 In the simplest case, input is presented, and it triggers some symbolic
 calculation in the SKS. The firing of some of the symbol neurons in the
 SKS triggers the firing of their corresponding concept neurons in the IKS.
 These, in turn, trigger a cascade of firing in the IKS, eventually resulting
 in some output. For example, inputting the number k triggers firing of
 a symbol neuron for the symbol 7 in the SKS, which in turn can trigger
 f
 iring of some concept neuron for that number. The IKS then produces
 a cascade of associations for that concept; for instance, for the number
 7, we can get the concept of seven deadly sins, seven samurai, or seven
 dwarfs. An output might be a rudimentary mental picture of one of these.
 The latency for this sort of operation is only a bit more than that for the
 multistep calculations within the SKS, because the computation in the
 IKS is fast.
 In a more complicated case, the semantics and intuitive associations for
 words, which arise in the IKS, can help the SKS in determining a sensible
 parse tree for a given input sentence. Another interesting interaction arises
 in solving a math problem: Here, the problem is input to the IKS, which
 uses its intuitive reasoning to produce ideas for solving the problem. These
 trigger the SKS to perform some formal calculations, producing partial
 results. These partial results then serve as new inputs to the IKS, which
 uses them to produce more ideas, and so on. The latency for such complex
 operations is essentially the sum of all the computation times in the IKS
 and SKS during all the phases of the interaction.
 4. Learning of concepts or relationships: Analogously to the IKS, the SKS
 can be modified by adding new symbol nodes and new connections, and
 by strengthening existing connections. Learning a new symbol should be
 as in the IKS, using some generic process for selecting an unused neuron.
 Again, this may use a Winner-Take-All mechanism.
 However, adding or strengthening connections between neurons should
 be different in the SKS from in the IKS: instead of using incremental
 Hebbian rules to strengthen edges that are frequently used, the SKS may
 make bigger, “all-at-once” increases in weights. This makes sense in view
 10
of the assumption that the changes in the SKS are produced purposefully,
 triggered by some external stimulus, rather than emerging accidentally
 as a result of random experiences. Making larger changes should lead to
 faster learning than an incremental Hebbian learning process.
 Lower level model: At a lower level of abstraction, the SKS can be repre
sented by another labeled, weighted, directed multi-graph, in which each con
cept has some number m of representing neurons, with all such sets disjoint.
 Edges can be similarly replicated. All this is as for the IKS, but we do not
 allow overlapping sets of neurons here. This ensures that the lower-level model
 for the SKS maintains clear separation between the representations of different
 symbols. This seems to be necessary for reliable computation.
 As for the IKS, the lower-level SKS model supports the same operations as
 the higher-level model. As for the IKS, the redundancy in the lower-level SKS
 model should yield greater reliability in the higher-level SKS model.
 Comparison between processing in the SKS and IKS: Processing in
 the SKS models is somewhat different from processing in their IKS counter
parts. For one thing, I assume that the individual elements of the SKS models
 are more reliable than those in the IKS models, which implies that processing
 should be generally more reliable. But also, there is a difference between the
 kinds of computations that are carried out in these two structures. In the IKS,
 when neurons fire, they trigger neighboring neurons to fire, according to general
 stochastic firing rules. On the other hand, the SKS is subject to more external
 control, which chooses which symbols to focus on and guides the computation
 step-by-step. An external mechanism probably helps in keeping track of inter
mediate results of the computation—see Section 2.5 for a discussion of Working
 Memory. Thus, the SKS can carry out precise, systematic computations, such
 as arithmetic calculations, whereas the IKS just produces general associations.
 2.4 Input and output
 Both the Symbolic and Intuitive Knowledge Structures accept inputs and pro
duce outputs.
 Inputs: In both the SKS andIKS, inputs arrive via special input neurons. For
 the SKS, these inputs encode symbols, and for the IKS, they encode intuitive
 concepts. The encoding scheme may depend on the type of input. For example,
 number inputs to the SKS could be input in unary or binary. For the IKS, we
 could have a unique input neuron for each intuitive concept, or a set of neurons
 (possibly with overlap between the sets for different concepts), or even a binary
 code. The inputs can be visual, auditory, written, olfactory, or tactile. Visual
 input might be provided using a feature vector, as in machine learning.
 11
Outputs: For the SKS, the outputs take the form of symbolic output, which
 might be drawn, written, spoken, or gestured. For the IKS, the outputs may be
 general impressions, such as an assessment of whether something is good, bad,
 or terrible, or it could be an emotional response. The SKS outputs could also
 be triggers for motor actions.
 2.5 Working memory
 The final component of the knowledge system is something I call the Working
 Memory. This is essential for computation in the SKS.5 The Working Memory
 contains a limited number of neurons that are used to keep track of intermediate
 results in an SKS computation. I think of the Working Memory neurons as
 representing “roles” in a computation, to be filled by specific numbers, words,
 or other symbols during computation. It might be useful to think of them as
 pointers into the SKS structure.
 For example, in a counting process, one Working Memory neuron might keep
 track of the number k that the system is up to in the count. If the system is
 counting symbols in a memorized sequence, another Working Memory neuron
 might keep track of the current symbol in the sequence. If the system is counting
 up to some goal number g (for example, because it is counting up to the gth
 element in a memorized sequence), then a third Working Memory neuron might
 indicate the goal. For parsing a simple sentence, the Working Memory might
 keep track of the subject, predicate, and object in the sentence.
 Implementing Working Memory: An important question is exactly how
 we should implement the Working Memory in a Spiking Neural Network model,
 specifically, how to represent the idea that a “role neuron” in Working Memory
 “points to” a particular symbol neuron in the SKS. We can’t actually store a
 pointer in a neuron, as we do in a programming system, so we need to emulate
 this connection somehow.
 One idea is to say that a role neuron points to a symbol neuron at a certain
 time t if and only if the two neurons both fire at that same time t. We might
 interpret this as meaning that the Working Memory is paying attention to, or
 focusing on, a particular symbol, at time t. In this case, we might say that the
 role neuron is “bound to” its current corresponding symbol neuron. We might
 strengthen this condition by requiring that the role neuron and symbol neuron
 f
 ire together for some number of consecutive times. Perhaps other conditions
 will need to be added.
 But this has an obvious problem: the same role neuron can fire together
 with two (or more) symbol neurons. So according to this definition, that would
 mean that one role neuron is pointing to more than one neuron at the same
 time. This does not seem too sensible if the binding between role neurons
 5I think it is very likely that a rudimentary type of Working Memory could also be used
 with the IKS, allowing the brain to focus attention on some intuitive concept without naming
 it with a symbol. But I will not discuss that here.
 12
and symbol neurons is supposed to represent focus. One way out might be to
 have the system maintain an invariant that prohibits such “split attention”.
 Implementing such an invariant might require a Winner-Take-All mechanism.
 Other technical issues arise, for example:
 • Suppose that we have two role neurons, each pointing to its own symbol
 neuron. In that case, we could allow all four neurons to fire together, but
 this seems confusing. It might be cleaner to separate the firing for the
 different bindings, for example, alternating the firing of the two pairs of
 neurons according to some simple pattern.6
 • What about two role neurons that point to the same symbol neuron? In
 that case, we could allow all three neurons to fire together. But again, an
 alternation discipline would probably be cleaner here: at some times, one
 role neuron fires along with the symbol neuron, and at other times, the
 other role neuron fires along with the same symbol neuron.
 Just having a role neuron and a symbol neuron firing together, in some pat
tern, doesn’t give us very much. We have to understand how this synchronized
 f
 iring helps in performing computation in the SKS, for example, in counting.
 Some preliminary thoughts about this appear in Section 4. For now, we just
 leave this as:
 Open question 1: Devise a concrete SNN mechanism for implementing a
 Working Memory, based on synchronizing role neurons and symbol neurons.
 Give specific examples of how this mechanism can be used in symbolic reasoning.
 2.6 Humans vs. animals
 Considering two knowledge structures, intuitive and symbolic, may help us to
 understand differences in thinking between humans and other animals. Non
human primates and other mammals have very well developed intuitive knowl
edge structures, in some ways better than humans’ structures, at least for the
 types of concepts that are important for the animals’ survival and comfort. I
 imagine that this structure is very similar to intuitive knowledge structure in
 humans.
 Thus, like a human’s IKS, an animal’s IKS is a labeled, weighted, directed
 multigraph, with unreliable nodes and edges. It connects to visual, auditory,
 and olfactory input neurons, and decision, emotion, an motor action output
 neurons. It receives input signals, which trigger a cascade of firings, which
 eventually trigger output behavior. It also supports learning, in that inputs can
 cause modifications to this structure, using Hebbian-style rules.
 However, I believe that animals have only a small, rudimentary symbolic
 knowledge structure (SKS), if any. Some animals (the most advanced apes)
 6Implementing such alternation might involve using some neurons as memories, along the
 lines of work by Hitron et al. [5].
 13
seem to be able to acquire a small vocabulary of symbols and use them in sim
ple ways [11, 12]. These should be able to fit into a small Lexicon, and might be
 processed in simple ways using a rudimentary SKS. We might say that animals
 that exhibit some basic ability to use symbols have a limited form of this funda
mentally human characteristic. I don’t consider that to be a contradiction, only
 an indication of the beginnings of a human capability in some higher primates.
 Can we match the theoretical IKS and SKS structures with actual areas of
 the human brain? For example, can we map the SKS to some part of the left
 brain and the IKS to some part of the right brain? Also, Friederici [4] provides
 evidence that certain connections between brain areas involved in language pro
cessing are much stronger in adult humans than in animals (or infant humans).
 Can we match these real connections with theoretical connections between the
 SKS and IKS?
 Language processing: What is the relationship between the SKS/IKS di
chotomy and language processing? I think it is natural to regard a parse tree,
 and more generally, the collection of parse trees representing the possible struc
tures of sentences in a language, as a symbolic knowledge structure. Let’s
 assume for now that this collection of possible parse trees is already memorized
 in the SKS, and not worry now about how it got there, whether by learning or
 evolution.
 Then what happens when a person hears (or reads) a sentence? They match
 up the words of the sentence with leaves in the parse trees in the SKS, and
 larger parts of the sentence with internal nodes in the parse trees. Somehow,
 this happens very quickly, at least for sentences with simple structure (such as
 3-word (noun, transitive verb, noun) sentences). The process of parsing a simple
 sentence may use Working Memory to describe the “roles” of the major parts of
 the sentence, such as subject, predicate, and object. It may also use semantic
 knowledge from the IKS, to help in disambiguating the sentence. Viewed in this
 way, the problem of parsing a sentence is a special case of symbolic computation
 in the SKS, possibly with some contribution from intuitive processing in the IKS.
 So then, what is the most important difference between human and animal
 capabilities with respect to language processing? I believe it is just that humans
 have a well-developed SKS that is capable of representing and manipulating
 formal relationships among linguistic symbols.
 Berwick and Chomsky’s theory of linguistic processing [1] reaches a rather
 different conclusion. They propose that the key difference is the ability of hu
mans to build arbitrarily complex hierarchical mental structures, such as com
plex sentences, using Merge operations and recursive grammar rules.
 I don’t think that can be exactly right. I have three comments. First,
 the Join/Merge operation, as studied, for example, by Valiant, seems to be
 applicable for intuitive concepts in the IKS, at least as much as for symbols in
 the SKS. Since the IKS is present in both humans and animals, it is likely that
 animals can perform simple intuitive Merges. In fact, I suspect that there is
 little difference between the abilities of humans and higher animals to construct
 14
intuitive hierarchies in the IKS.
 Second, when we talk about recursive grammar rules, we are talking about
 sophisticated symbol manipulations, which humans can do and animals cannot.
 Then we are in the realm of symbolic reasoning, which involves the SKS.
 And third, I don’t think that humans can actually construct arbitrarily
 complex hierarchies in their SKSs. For instance, it seems to me that a human
 can keep track of only three or four levels of structural depth in a sentence’s
 parse tree. The SKS in the human brain probably has some graph-theoretic
 limitations, which impose limits on the size and depth of the linguistic structures
 that can be represented. Also, perhaps understanding a sentence with very
 complex structure requires focusing on a large number of symbols at once—
 more than can be handled in Working Memory.7
 At any rate, it seems to me that the important distinction in linguistic abil
ities is simply that humans can do sophisticated symbolic processing, whereas
 animals cannot.
 In Sections 3-5, I give two examples to illustrate the ideas of Section 2. We
 focus on the case where the structures of interest are already learned, and men
tion learning only later, in Section 6. Our examples involve traversing sequences
 of symbols and parsing simple sentences.
 3 Sequences
 To make the ideas of Section 2 more concrete, I define here here a simplified,
 special case of a symbolic knowledge structure, namely, a memorized finite se
quence of distinct symbols. Using this SKS, one might compute, for example,
 the symbol that appears in a particular position in the sequence. Following this
 computation with further computation using an intuitive knowledge structure
 might produce some reactions related to a concept denoted by this symbol.
 3.1 Representation
 Let’s consider a finite sequence of k distinct symbols, s1,s2,...,sk. Let S denote
 the set of symbols in the sequence.
 We assume that the SKS is a linear directed graph, with nodes (= neurons)
 corresponding to the k symbols. Denote the node for symbol s by rep(s). These
 nodes are connected in increasing sequential order, where each rep(si) has a
 directed edge to rep(si+1). In addition, each rep node has a self-loop. Weights
 on all these edges are positive, so that firing of one rep node at one time t
 encourages the firing of the next rep node in the sequence, and also encourages
 its own firing, at time t+1. We assume that the nodes are threshold elements or
 7Of course, if we expand the SKS and Working Memory by writing things down on paper,
 as humans can do, then much more complex hierarchies could be represented. But this is not
 a fair comparison—let’s stick to the internal capabilities of the brain.
 15
have their firing determined by very steep sigmoids, and all components behave
 reliably.
 The IKS contains one or more intuitive concept neurons for each symbol in
 the SKS. These connect to other concepts using positive weight edges, in arbi
trary ways. Concept neurons for the successive elements of S are not connected
 to each other in a systematic pattern. The neurons may use shallow sigmoids,
 and the components need not behave completely reliably.
 For each symbol s ∈ S, we also have directed edges between rep(s) and each
 intuitive concept neuron for s, in both directions.
 Example: The Greek alphabet and virus variants: We consider the
 sequence of 24 Greek letters, alpha, beta, ..., omega. This can be memorized in
 the SKS, in the manner just described.
 Each Greek letter is associated with numerous intuitive concepts, includ
ing mathematical notions, hurricanes, and most importantly for this paper, a
 variant of a certain aggressive virus. Each of these intuitive concepts has a
 corresponding intuitive concept node in the IKS.
 For example, consider virus variants. For this paper, we pretend that every
 Greek letter has exactly one associated virus variant.8 Loosely associated with
 a virus variant are many of its properties, including where it originated, how
 contagious it was, how serious an impact it had, approximately how many people
 caught it, whether it caused widespread business and and school shut-downs,
 whether a lot of people died, etc. This is all informal understanding, and is
 represented by nodes and edges in the IKS. These thoughts are all produced
 quickly, along the lines of Kahneman’s fast thinking.
 In order to define abstract problems involving Greek letters and virus vari
ants, we also include special output neurons in the IKS. These can represent
 informal decisions about the virus variant, such as whether the variant was OK,
 bad, or terrible. They can also represent emotional reactions, such as neutral,
 scary, or terrifying.
 3.2 Queries
 We define two natural queries for sequences, both of which involve counting
 symbols and evaluating associated intuitive concepts. Answering them will in
volve a combination of symbolic and intuitive reasoning. For these queries, we
 assume that each symbol neuron has exactly one corresponding intuitive concept
 neuron.
 1. The input is a “goal number” g in the allowed range 1,...,k, where k is
 the length of the sequence. The output should be a decision, or emotional
 reaction, derived from the firings in the IKS starting from rep(sg).
 8For the COVID virus, that is not quite true: we are currently not done with the list, but
 are stalled at omicron. Also, someone decided to skip the letters nu and xi, for reasons that
 should be easy to guess.
 16
What is the “correct” response for this query? This is defined by the
 structure—edges and weights—of the relevant part of the IKS, which can
 be arbitrary. According to the IKS execution rules, when the concept
 neuron rep(sg) fires, it triggers a cascade of firing of other IKS neurons.
 This yields a probability distribution on decision neurons, or emotional
 reaction neurons, that are reached by the cascade, by any particular time.
 We require that the output for the query follow this distribution.
 In the most interesting case, the IKS operation guarantees that, for some
 time t, with very high probability, the firing decision or emotional re
action neuron is unique, and moreover, that the firing pattern for deci
sion/emotion neurons persists from time t onward. In this case, the query
 response should also stabilize to a unique value by some time t, with high
 probability.
 2. There are two inputs, a symbol s in the set S and a goal number g in
 the range {1,...,k − i}, where s = si. The output should be the correct
 decision or emotional reaction, derived from the firings in the IKS starting
 from rep(si+g).
 The correct response for this query is defined as in the first query, based
 on IKS behavior starting from rep(si+g).
 Answering the queries: The first issue that must be addressed, for process
ing queries like these, is the representation of their inputs. In this case, how does
 one input a number in {1,...,k}? How does one input a symbol s? I propose
 that, for now, we consider the simplest possibilities:
 • For numbers in {1,...,k}, use simple unary representation. Assume we
 have a dedicated input neuron for each number in this range, which is
 triggered to fire by some external stimulus, in order to input the number.
 • For symbols in S, we could allocate one input neuron for each symbol.
 As it happens, the processing of these two queries can be broken down into
 sequential phases: provide symbolic inputs, use symbolic computation to iden
tify a particular symbol neuron in the SKS, move to the corresponding intuitive
 concept neuron in the IKS, and then let the cascade in the IKS produce the final
 result. One could also consider queries whose processing involves more elabo
rate interactions between the two structures; examples of this sort might arise,
 for example, in parsing and understanding sentences. But for now, let’s focus
 on these simple Queries 1 and 2, with their stylized one-way communication
 pattern between the SKS and IKS.
 During the symbolic processing phase of these queries, we will also use the
 Working Memory, to keep track of particular symbols that the computation is
 currently focusing on.
 So how might the answers to Queries 1 and 2 be computed? For Query 1,
 we will count up to the input goal number g, moving step-by-step through a
 17
sequence of neurons representing consecutive positive integers. As we do this,
 for each step, we also move one step in the sequential SKS. When we reach
 the number g, we must recognize that we have reached it, and identify the
 associated intuitive concept neuron. The firing of this neuron starts the cascade
 that eventually produces the ouput. It remains to express this strategy as a
 formal SNN; a start at this appears in Section 4.
 Query 2 will be answered similarly. This time, we start at the symbol neuron
 in the SKS that is indicated by the symbol input. Again, we traverse the SKS
 while counting up to the input number g, then continue processing in the IKS.
 Thus, both of these queries involve simple linear traversals of the SKS, while
 counting the number of steps that have been traversed.
 Example: The Greek alphabet and virus variants: For Query 1, we
 have k = 24, so the goal number input is any number g ∈ {1,...,24}. The
 output is an assessment of how bad the virus variant was that was associated
 with the Greek letter at position g in the Greek alphabet. For example, input
 4 gives the delta variant, which might produce output “terrible” based on the
 number of cases and deaths. Similarly, for Query 2, we ask how bad the virus
 variant was that is associated with the Greek letter in position g after the variant
 symbolized by s.
 Complexity analysis: When we define formal SNN algorithms for answering
 these queries, we would like some way of measuring their computational com
plexity. I focus here on latency, measured in terms of the number of basic steps
 in the SNN model.
 The strategies outlined above involve computation in the SKS followed by
 computation in the IKS. In this special case, we can obtain a bound on latency
 simply by adding the time bounds for these two phases of computation (plus
 one extra step for the time from when the final symbol neuron fires to when its
 corresponding intuitive concept neuron fires).
 The time for computation in the IKS is the time from when the initial intu
itive concept neuron fires until a decision or emotion neuron fires persistently.
 This corresponds to the time to follow some number of links in the IKS, plus
 perhaps some time to suppress all but one candidate decision. We don’t know
 the number of links, and it is not clear yet how many candidate decisions there
 will be, nor exactly how one decision will be selected. So for now, we encapsu
late all this in a parameter, tiks. In any case, this should be a small number,
 qualifying as fast thinking in Kahneman’s sense.
 The time for computation in the SKS will be the time to follow g links in
 the SKS, focusing on one link at a time. It is not clear how long it will take to
 follow a single link, so for now, we make this another parameter, tsks. Then the
 total time for each of the queries would be roughly gtsks + tiks + 1.
 In Section 4, we give some technical details for possible mechanisms for
 answering these queries. The reader may want to skip that section for now, and
 move on to our other example, in Section 5.

4 More Details for Reasoning about Sequences
 Here I consider theoretical mechanisms that might be involved in answering
 queries like those in Section 3.
 We need a mechanism for counting up to the gth symbol in the memorized
 sequence. I assume that Working Memory includes three neurons, a current
number neuron that keeps track of a natural number k representing where we
 are up to in the count, a current-symbol neuron that keeps track of the corre
sponding symbol in the sequence, and a goal neuron that holds the goal number
 g. These neurons represent three distinct “roles”, which will, during the com
putation, synchronize with particular symbol neurons that fill these roles.
 We must pin down exactly how a role neuron synchronizes with a symbol
 neuron. I described some ideas for this in Section 2.5, but left the specifics as
 an open question. Basically the role neuron and a corresponding symbol neu
ron fire together, though questions remain about exactly what synchronization
 conditions they satisfy. Another issue is how the system produces this synchro
nized firing. This may require that the graph contain directed edges in both
 directions, between the role neuron and all the possible symbol neurons in the
 SKS that might potentially fill this role. These edges can contribute potential
 between the two neurons so that once they are both firing, each can help the
 other to continue firing.
 In the rest of this section, I elaborate on some issues involved in answering the
 queries. Section 4.1 describes the core of the implementation: a mechanism for
 incrementing the count by 1 while moving one step in the sequence of symbols.
 Section 4.2 describes how to start and end the counting process. Section 4.3
 discusses how to tie it all together to answer the queries.
 Note: We have a small confusion in terminology here. So far, I have been
 referring to the elements in the memorized sequence as “symbols”. But symbols
 are really a broader classification, including, for example, natural numbers. In
 this section, I will be dealing with natural numbers as well as elements of the
 memorized sequence, and I will need to distinguish the two. So for the rest of
 this section, I will use the word “symbols” generically, to indicate any kind of
 symbol, “numbers” for natural numbers, and “letters” for the symbols in the
 memorized sequence (as in the Greek alphabet example). I will rename the
 current-symbol neuron to be the current-letter neuron.
 4.1 Incrementing the count
 I begin with a sketch of a mechanism for incrementing the count by one. Here
 I use the notation rep(si) for the neuron for the ith letter (as I defined earlier),
 and also use rep(i) for the neuron for number i.
 Consider any fixed i ∈ {1,...,k − 1}. The increment operation starts with
 the current-number neuron in the Working Memory bound to neuron rep(i),
 and the current-letter neuron in the Working Memory bound to neuron rep(si).
 Specifically, we start with the current-number and current-letter neurons firing,
 along with the symbol neurons rep(i) and rep(si). The result should be that the
 19
current-number neuron gets bound to rep(i+1), and the current-letter neuron
 gets bound to rep(si+1). That is, we should end with the current-number and
 current-letter neurons firing, along with the symbol neurons rep(i + 1) and
 rep(si+1).
 We assume that the increment is triggered by some special next input signal,
 produced by the firing of a special input neuron.
 Incrementing numbers only: First, I ignore the letters and focus just on
 incrementing the numerical count. I start with a static description of the neu
rons and connections. We have a single current-number neuron in the Working
 Memory and a sequence of number neurons in the SKS. All are modeled as
 threshold gates. The number neurons have threshold given by a parameter h;
 the threshold for the current-number neuron is 0.
 The current-number neuron has directed edges to all the number neurons,
 each having weight c. Each number neuron has a directed edge to the next
 higher number neuron, with weight s. Each number neuron also has a self-loop,
 with weight l.
 In addition, we will have some incoming edges that provide external control
 of parts of the computation. Specifically, we have incoming edges to all the
 number neurons from a single external excitatory source, with weight exc, and
 likewise incoming edges to the number neurons from an external inhibitory
 source, with weight inh. More formally, we define the following parameters:
 • h, the threshold for each number neuron.
 • cur, the weight on the edge from the current-number neuron to each num
ber neuron.
 • l, the weight on the self-loop for each number neuron.
 • s, the weight on the edge from each number neuron to its successor number
 neuron.
 • s′, a value somewhat less than s.
 • exc, the incoming weight on the edges from an external excitatory source
 to all the number neurons.
 • inh, the incoming (negative) weight on the edges from an external in
hibitory neuron to all the number neurons.
 We require that the parameters satisfy the following inequalities:
 1. h ≤cur+l
 2. h >s+cur
 3. h ≤exc+s+cur
 4. h >exc+cur
 20
5. h >cur+l+inh
 6. h ≤cur+l+inh+s′
 Many values satisfy all of these inequalities, such as: cur = 0, l = 4, h = 3,
 s =2, exc =2, inh = −2, s′ = 1.
 Now, how does this mechanism operate? At time 0, the current-number
 neuron and number neuron rep(i) are both firing. The subsequent behavior is
 completely determined by the structure of the network, the initial settings, and
 the arrival of external inputs. (There is no stochasticity here, since the involved
 neurons are all deterministic threshold elements.) The mechanism is triggered
 to start the increment process by the arrival of an excitatory input from an
 external source at all the number nodes. This is supposed to start the firing of
 number neuron rep(i+1). After a small delay, an inhibitory input arrives at all
 the number nodes. This is supposed to stop the firing of number neuron rep(i).
 Here, informally, are the main requirements on the mechanism’s behavior:
 • If the current-number neuron and number neuron rep(i), are firing, they
 continue firing without any external input. If rep(i) is firing, it doesn’t
 trigger number neuron rep(i+1) to fire in the absence of any other inputs
 to rep(i + 1).
 • If an external excitatory input arrives at all the number neurons while
 number neuron rep(i) is firing, the next number neuron, rep(i+1), starts
 f
 iring, while rep(i) continues firing. No other number neurons start firing.
 • If both rep(i) and rep(i + 1) are firing, and an inhibitory input arrives
 at all the number neurons, then rep(i) stops firing, while rep(i +1) keeps
 f
 iring.
 These considerations motivate the inequalities on the parameters, as follows.
 Inequality 1 says that h ≤ cur +l. This says that the incoming potential from
 the current-number neuron, plus the incoming potential from the self-loop on
 number neuron rep(i), are enough to exceed rep(i)’s firing threshold. That
 means that rep(i) continues firing without any external input.
 Inequality 2 says that h > s + cur. This says that incoming potential from
 number neuron rep(i), plus the incoming potential from the current-number
 neuron, are not enough, on their own, to trigger firing of rep(i + 1).
 Inequality 3 says that h ≤ exc+s+cur. This says that, when the incoming
 potential to number neuron rep(i + 1) from rep(i), and the incoming poten
tial from the current-number neuron, are augmented by an external excitatory
 signal, the combination is enough to exceed rep(i + 1)’s firing threshold, and
 thereby trigger it to fire.
 Inequality 4 says that h > ext+cur. This says that incoming potential from
 the external signal, when added to that from the current-number neuron, is not
 enough to cause any other number neuron besides rep(i + 1) to start firing.
 So far, we have arguedthe first twobullets above, which describe hownumber
 neuron rep(i + 1) starts firing. The third bullet deals with stopping the firing
 21
of rep(i). First, Inequality 5 says that h > cur + l + inh. This means that
 the incoming (negative) potential from an inhibitory source, when added to the
 potential from the current-number neuron and the self-loop, is not enough to
 reach the threshold for rep(i). So this will have the effect of stopping the firing
 of rep(i).
 But now we must be careful, because we don’t want the inhibition to also
 stop the firing of rep(i+1). When rep(i) neuron stops firing, its contribution of
 potential to rep(i+1) ceases. So that leaves only potential cur from the current
number neuron, plus l from rep(i + 1)’s self-loop, reduced by the inhibition
 amount inh. Inequality 1 tells us that h ≤ cur +l, but we don’t have anything
 to tell us that h ≤ cur +l +inh, which is what we need here.
 One way out is to extend the model of [8] by allowing the neurons to remem
ber some history of incoming potential. We have extended the model in this way
 before [14]. Essentially, we want to allow the potential contribution from rep(i)
 to degrade over a short period of time (for the time during which the inhibitory
 input persists), rather than disappear immediately. We could capture this by
 assuming that some residual potential contribution of magnitude s′ < s persists
 for at least as long as the interval when the inhibition is being applied. Then
 Inequality 6, which says that h ≤ cur +l +inh+s′, will tell us that rep(i +1)
 has enough incoming potential to keep firing during the inhibition interval. This
 seems rather delicate, but not necessarily unrealistic.
 Incrementing numbers and letters: How can we augment the mechanism
 just defined to increment both the number and the corresponding letter? Well,
 it seems that the same mechanism can work for both sequences, sequentially
 or in parallel. For a parallel solution, we can send the same excitatory and
 inhibitory signals to both the number neurons and the letter neurons. There
 should be no interaction between the two parts. A sequential solution would
 involve separate excitatory and inhibitory signals for the two types of neurons,
 with alternating applications of the signals for the numbers and the letters.
 4.2 Starting and stopping the count
 Next, I consider how to start and stop the count. Consider Query 1.
 Starting: We need a way of triggering the firing of the first number neuron,
 rep(1), and the first letter neuron, rep(s1). Since these neurons have no in
coming potential from predecessor neurons, we will use some special input to
 get them firing. Namely, we assume an external excitatory neuron, with edges
 to both the current-number and current-letter neurons, with sufficiently high
 weight to meet their thresholds. The external neuron also has edges to the
 number neuron rep(1) and the letter neuron rep(s1). These latter two edges
 have weight s + exc instead of just exc as in the incremental mechanism. The
 extra s compensates for the fact that neurons rep(1) and rep(s1) don’t receive
 potential contributions of s from their predecessors.
 22
We also must set the goal to a particular desired goal number g. For this,
 we use another external input to excite the goal neuron to begin firing. And,
 we input the goal number g in unary, and thereby trigger the number neuron
 rep(g) to fire.
 But now we have a danger of confusion involving the number neurons.
 Namely, after these initializations, both the current-number and goal Working
 Memory neurons are firing, together with their corresponding number neurons.
 So there is a danger of confusion between the goal number and the current num
ber. We need a way to disambiguate this. As noted in Section 2.5, this probably
 involves a synchronization protocol, such as alternating the firing activities for
 the two Working Memory neurons.
 Stopping: The mechanism must also recognize when the current count has
 reached the goal number g. This requires an equality-detection mechanism to
 recognize that the goal and current-number Working Memory neurons are bound
 to the same number neuron. The design of such a mechanism would depend
 on how we are resolving the ambiguity in the bindings. For example, if we are
 simply alternating the firings of the two pairs of neurons, then the mechanism
 would have to recognize when the same number neuron fired at consecutive
 times. This might be implemented by maintaining some firing history in the
 state of each number neuron, or in special neurons as in [5].
 When the count is finished, we might also want to stop the firing of the
 current-number neuron. For this, we should use some inhibitory input. This
 remains to be worked out.
 For Query 2, starting the count is slightly different, in that an external input
 is used to trigger the firing of the starting letter neuron. Starting the current
number neuron, and ending the count, are as before. Stopping is as before.
 4.3 Answering the queries
 The complete solution to Query 1 involves advancing through the number
 and letter sequences in parallel, until the equality mechanism detects that the
 current-number neuron and the goal neuron bind to the same number neuron.
 At that point, computational activity shifts to the IKS: another external
 excitatory input signal gets sent to all the intuitive concept neurons in the IKS
 that correspond to letter neurons in the SKS. The unique currently-firing letter
 neuron in the SKS also contributes potential to its corresponding intuitive con
cept neuron in the IKS. Based on a combination of these two types of potential,
 the correct intuitive concept neuron for the chosen letter starts firing.
 Once the correct intuitive concept neuron starts firing, it causes a cascade of
 f
 irings in the IKS, which yields a probability distribution of decision neurons, or
 emotional reaction neurons, that are reached by the cascade. Under plausible
 assumptions about the IKS, with high probability, this soon leads (within some
 time tiks) to a unique, persistent decision. Analyzing this probability will require
 23
a more detailed model of how the firing cascades operate in the IKS.
 The overall latency for answering the query will be approximately gd+tiks,
 for some constant d, where we are allowing d steps to account for each increment
 of current-number.
 Processing for Query 2 is similar, and we leave that to the reader. The
 difference is in the initialization of current-number.
 5 Parse Trees
 The second example of a symbolic knowledge structure is a parse tree for a
 sentence. A parse tree, as studied in linguistics, consists of nonterminals at the
 internal nodes of a tree and terminals at the leaves. Parse trees are generally
 constructed based on context-free grammar rules. Since these rules are recursive,
 this allows for the construction of arbitrarily large and complex parse trees.
 However, sentences that are normally encountered in practice are not very large
 or complex, so their parse trees are rather small.
 In this paper, I consider a variant of the usual parse trees, in which the
 children of every node in the tree are unordered. For example, a sentence may
 consist of a subject noun, predicate verb, and object noun, but the order of these
 three elements is not significant. In different languages, these three elements
 might be presented, orally or in writing, in different orders—say, (subject, pred
icate, object) vs. (subject, object, predicate). But in the SKS representation,
 it is enough to remember just that the sentence consists of these three parts.
 Unlike the sequences in Sections 3 and 4, I do not assume that the parse trees
 are memorized in the SKS ahead of time. Rather, the words of a sentence are
 presented as input (by hearing or reading), and the parse tree gets constructed
 on-the-fly. However, I think it is very likely that the general structure of typical
 parse trees is built into the brain a priori, as a result of evolution or early learn
ing. For example, for 3-word sentences that consist of just a subject, predicate,
 and object, there is probably a built-in structure in the SKS that represents this
 general parse tree structure. The particular nouns and verb that appear in a
 particular sentence are, of course, not built in, but are filled in during processing
 of the sentence. For more complex sentences, more work will be needed during
 sentence processing to determine the structure of the tree, as well as for filling
 in the words.
 In any case, during sentence processing, an (unordered) parse tree gets con
structed in the SKS. Some simplified representation of this tree then gets passed
 to the IKS, which associates intuitive meaning with the sentence via cascades of
 f
 iring, producing as output a kind of “story”. Here I am drastically simplifying
 matters, by neglecting the possibility that the IKS helps in constructing the
 parse tree. This sort of semantic disambiguation is common in language under
standing, but I will restrict attention for now to sentences that can be parsed
 based just on their syntax.
 24
Example: 3-word sentences: As a special case, I will sometimes consider
 parse trees with a very simple structure corresponding to 3-word sentences con
sisting of a subject noun, predicate verb, and object noun.
 In terms of traditional context-free grammars, the nonterminals are Sen
tence, Subject, Predicate, Object, Noun, and TransitiveVerb, with Sentence as
 the starting nonterminal. The set of terminals is a large collection of already
memorized nouns and transitive verbs. The formal grammar productions are:
 • Sentence ⇒ Subject Predicate Object9.
 • Subject ⇒ Noun, Predicate ⇒ TransitiveVerb, Object ⇒ Noun.
 • Noun ⇒ boy, baby, horse, ball, banana, tablecloth,...; Verb ⇒ kicks, eats,
 sews,...
 In this special case, verbs are always present tense. Example sentences include
 “Boykicks ball.”, “Baby eats banana.”, “Horse sews tablecloth.”, etc. Assuming
 this general parse tree structure is built into the SKS a priori, what remains to
 be done during parsing is just filling in the terminals.
 For more general cases, I will consider more complicated sentences and parse
 trees, and also cases where the sentence structure is not known a priori, but must
 be determined during sentence processing. In this latter case, additional work
 will be involved in determining the parse tree structure, in addition to the work
 of filling in the terminals.
 Some details appear in the next two subsections. But this is all quite pre
liminary, and there is much more to be done.
 5.1 Representation and computation in the SKS
 Here I describe how parse trees might be represented in the SKS, how the parsing
 process might work, and what output is produced.
 Parse tree representation: A parse tree could be represented in the SKS
 fairly directly, with a neuron representing each node of the tree and edges con
necting the neurons that represent parents and children in the tree. Note that
 this neural network representation does not specify any ordering for the chil
dren of a node, which is fine since we are considering unordered versions of parse
 trees. The terminal and nonterminal symbols are also represented by neurons
 in the Lexicon; for each such symbol that occurs in a parse tree, there are edges
 back and forth between the Lexicon entry and the neurons in the parse tree that
 are labeled by that symbol.
 The parse tree for an input sentence can be constructed in the SKS by
 allocating neurons for the nodes in the parse tree and establishing the needed
 9But recall that the order of the three elements is not significant. We should more properly
 regard the right-hand side of this production as a set consisting of these three nonterminals.
 This simplification will probably affect the representations and their processing costs.
 25
connections. This may seem like a time-consuming learning process, which
 is inconsistent with the speed with which humans recognize basic sentences.
 However, the process can be sped up if the high-level portions of the tree are
 already represented in the SKS, as a result of evolution or previous learning.
 This captures the idea that the brain starts the parsing process already having
 built-in familiarity with standard sentence structures. I think this is reasonable,
 and I will assume it from now on.
 In fact, to make things as simple as possible, I will assume here that the SKS
 maintains a collection of standard sentence structures, each with a complete
 parse tree shape and all of its nonterminals filled in. Moreover, every sentence
 that is input will fit one of these standard structures. So the only things that
 need to be filled in are the terminals.10
 The parsing process: Given our strong assumptions, the parsing process
 needs to perform only two tasks: (1) determine which standard structure fits
 the given sentence, and (2) finish the construction of the parse tree by associating
 specific terminals to the leaves.
 Since sentences are input word-by-word, it seems plausible that the SKS
 might start out with a large collection of possible sentence structures, and nar
row down the set of possibilities with each new word, until only one possible
 structure remains. For each new word that is input, the SKS tries to incorpo
rate the word into its proper place in each of its still-possible parse trees. If
 it fails (for example, because the new word is the wrong part of speech for the
 structure), then the SKS drops the structure from its set of possibilities.
 For example, consider two sentence structures: (subject, predicate, object)
 and (subject, predicate). Suppose that an English sentence is being presented,
 and its second word is a verb that can be either transitive or intransitive (such
 as eats, runs, reads, etc.). Then after the first two words arrive, both structures
 are still possible, and the verb can be assigned to a leaf in both of their parse
 trees. After that, either the sentence ends, or another noun arrives. This leads
 to attempts to match both partial parse trees, but only one succeeds.
 It remains to devise a workable SNN-based data structure for keeping track
 of the set of possibilities. This should include: a way of representing multiple
 parse trees in the SKS; a mechanism to incorporate each successive input into
 each possible parse tree, producing an indicator when this is impossible; and a
 mechanism to identify when only one parsetree remains in the set of possibilities.
 During construction of a parse tree, the Working Memory will help in assign
ing terminals to particular leaves of the tree. For example, in a simple (Subject,
 Predicate, Object) sentence, a Working Memory neuron may represent the Sub
ject role, and may bind to a symbol neuron for a particular noun. This binding
 should persist long enough to establish the firing patterns needed to incorporate
 the noun into the SKS representation of the parse tree.11
 10This is definitely an oversimplification of real sentence processing, but I think it is worth
 understanding this case first.
 11The use of Working Memory will be more complicated in more complicated sentences.
 26
Although the internal SKS representations for parse trees are language
independent, the method of assigning terminals to nodes in the parse trees
 is language-specific. For example, consider simple three-word (subject, predi
cate, object) sentences. Recall that the parse trees do not specify an order for
 these three parts of the sentence. But particular languages will have their own
 ordering conventions. For example, in English, the first word in a sentence will
 generally be the Subject, the second the Predicate, and the third the Object.
 Other languages may use different conventions. These language conventions
 lead to different rules for parsing an input sentence. In this way, we can have a
 language-independent internal representation of the sentence structure, with a
 language-specific way of performing the parse.
 This all suggests to me that the internal SKS parse tree representations may
 be built-in, as a result of evolution, whereas particular languages are certainly
 learned. It remains to develop particular learning algorithms by which the brain
 can learn different parsing methods for different languages, all based on the same
 SKS parse tree structures.
 Output of the SKS: In any case, the SKS eventually produces the parse
 tree for an input sentence. Actually, it probably doesn’t retain the entire parse
 tree; for example, the intermediate neurons representing the nonterminals Noun
 and TransitiveVerb are not necessary once parsing is finished. So what the SKS
 produces is a reduced version of the parse tree; for example, for a simple 3-word
 sentence, the reduced version will probably contain some representation of the
 sentence as a whole, of the three parts of the sentence, and of the actual nouns
 and verbs that make up these parts.12
 Arbitrarily complex sentence structures: For standard sentence struc
tures, the representations of the parse trees are compact and fit easily in the
 SKS. Also, the Working Memory is large enough to keep track of the parts of the
 sentence and manage the parsing process. But this is not the case for arbitrarily
 complex sentence structures. In order to construct very large parse trees, the
 parts that don’t fit in the SKS and Working Memory would have to be recorded
 somewhere outside the SKS, perhaps on paper. There is no limit to how much
 can be written on paper!
 Consider the sentence “The boy who eats the candy pets the duck.” The phrase “The boy
 who eats the candy” can be parsed first, with the help of Working Memory neurons. The
 result of this parsing is a branch of a parse tree. But then we want to treat the entire phrase
 as a unit, to be related to the rest of the sentence. So a nonterminal symbol node in the SKS
 that represents this entire phrase can bind to a Working Memory neuron that corresponds
 to the role “Subject”, and the rest of the parse can proceed. In fact, the same neurons in
 Working Memory might be reused in different parts of the parse, e.g., a Subject role neuron
 can bind to a neuron representing the terminal “boy” in parsing the first phrase, and later to
 a neuron representing the subtree for the entire phrase “The boy who eats the candy”.
 12This representation might be a small labeled graph of neurons, containing a neuron for
 the sentence and one for each of its three terminals. Edges between the sentence neuron and
 the terminal neurons could be labeled by their roles—subject, predicate, or object.
 27
5.2 Representation and computation in the IKS
 Now what happens to the (reduced) representation of the parse tree that is
 produced by the SKS? Basically, the firing of the neurons in this representa
tion, possibly with the help of some external signal, should trigger the firing of
 some related intuitive concept neurons in the IKS. Then the IKS firing cascades
 proceed until they result in some output.
 The intuitive concept neurons that are triggered should comprise some type
 of outline for the “story” that the parsed sentence tells.13 This should be a
 collection of neurons that together represent the individual components and the
 relationships between them; the precise structure for this outline remains to be
 determined. In the case of simple 3-word sentences, we might have one concept
 neuron that represents the general idea of a “story” plus neurons representing
 the three concepts that comprise the story, tagged somehow by their roles in the
 story (as in the SKS representation). But there may be more to it: a verb might
 be represented, not by a single concept neuron, but by a collection of neurons
 that fire according to some timing pattern corresponding to the action denoted
 by the verb. “Kicks” would probably be represented by some neurons whose
 f
 iring corresponds to the action of kicking, including its direction and speed.
 Open question 2: Pin down precise reduced representations for parse trees
 in the SKS, and precise representations for outlines for simple stories in the
 IKS. Develop a mechanism by which an SKS representation of a parse tree can
 trigger the corresponding IKS representation of a story outline.
 Once these initial concept neurons are triggered, they start the usual IKS
 cascade of firing, continuing until some IKS output is produced. This cascade
 does not follow just the associations that arise from the individual elements
 of the sentence/story, but also the combinations of the elements and the re
lationships between them. That is, the cascade selects for associations that
 are relevant to the story. For example, in the sentence “Boy kicks ball.”, the
 combination of words is likely to trigger a picture of a boy aged 6-10 running
 outdoors, kicking a soccer-ball-sized ball, rather than a picture of a baby boy
 sitting indoors, or a golf ball on a tee. The sentence “Horse sews tablecloth.”
 is likely to trigger a cartoon of a horse sitting at a table, but is unlikely to
 trigger a picture of a racehorse at a racetrack or an elegant lace tablecloth in a
 dinner setting. The context provided by the other parts of the story and their
 relationships influence the associations that arise from each particular part.
 Such a cascade pattern should arise naturally in a Spiking Neural Network
 model because the neurons representing the various parts of a story all con
tribute potential to other concept neurons. This potential adds up, thereby
 13This may bring to mind Winston’s emphasis on “stories” produced in the brain [16]. How
ever, Winston’s stories are different: they are paragraphs consisting of many short sentences,
 from which a computer program can extract meaning. It is possible that the representations
 used in this computer programs might provide ideas for how simple stories can be represented
 in an IKS model.
 28
encouraging the firing of neurons for concepts that are relevant to the entire
 story, rather than just the individual parts.
 The IKS representation of the story gets refined over a short period of time,
 as a result of the cascade of IKS neuron firings. The IKS representation that
 is triggered directly by the SKS representation, that is, the story outline, is
 probably rudimentary, and gets more detailed over a short time, as more context
 information gets incorporated. All of this is still fast thinking, since the actions
 of the IKS cascade are fast.
 What is the final output that is produced by this IKS process? It should be a
 mental picture of the activity in the story. Such a picture might be represented in
 the IKS using a typical internal form for visual processing in computer vision—
 an abstract two-dimensional picture that has rudimentary representations of the
 key components (stick figures, outlines of buildings, etc.). It can be a kind of
 cartoon. The picture will usually be dynamic, since one of its constituents is a
 verb, indicating an action.
 As we had for the sequence example, we could have a further IKS output
 representing the main judgment or emotion that is triggered by the picture,
 such as “pleasant”, “unpleasant”, or “absurd”.
 Interaction between SKS and IKS: We have been considering only a spe
cial case of sentence understanding in which the SKS performs symbolic pro
cessing first, then passes control to the IKS, which produces a picture of the
 story, and judges whether the story is pleasant, unpleasant, absurd, etc. This
 one-way interaction is similar to what happens in our sequence example. More
 elaborate parsing examples would incorporate feedback from the IKS to the
 SKS, for instance, when semantic information is used to resolve ambiguities in
 the parse structure.
 6 Learning the Representations
 So far, I have described situations in which symbolic knowledge structures have
 already been established. But we should also consider how these structures
 might become established in the first place, by evolution or learning. Some
 structures may be innate, such as a neural structure that is particularly suited
 for learning arbitrary sequences or hierarchical structures, or for recognizing
 certain standard types of sentences. But many other structures must be learned
 from experience. I won’t go into depth here about learning issues, but will
 simply give a high-level overview.
 Here are some general types of things that must be learned. In all cases, we
 can consider the changes at two levels of abstraction, and how they correspond
 at the two levels.
 1. New intuitive concepts: These must get placed somewhere in the IKS.
 New neuron(s) must be selected to represent them. This might involve
 the use of a Winner-Take-All mechanism. Valiant’s book [15] contains
 29
some example protocols based on random graphs. Lynch and Mallmann
Trenn [7] present others based on identifying the candidate neuron with
 the highest incoming potential.
 2. New symbols: These must get placed somewhere in the SKS, and also in
 the Lexicon. The method of choosing new representing neurons can be
 similar to what is used in the IKS. Also, for each new symbol, connections
 must be set up in both directions between the neurons in the Lexicon and
 those in the SKS corresponding to the new symbol.
 3. Connections between intuitive concepts: Since people (and probably other
 animals) can learn to relate any pair of intuitive concepts, the brain must
 have sufficient physical connections between concept neurons to support
 this learning. These connections can be strengthened or weakened as a
 result of experiences.
 Thus, the underlying directed graph in the IKS should also be sufficiently
 connected. Edge weights should increase and decrease in response to expe
riences, according to some version of Hebbian learning. This learning will
 probably be gradual because of the noisy nature of learning of intuitive
 concepts and relationships.
 4. Connections between symbols: Learning a symbolic structure, such as a
 sequence or linguistic structure, is different from learning connections be
tween intuitive concepts. It doesn’t just happen automatically, as a result
 of experience, but requires attention, is more purposeful, and is controlled
 by some outside stimulus. The process should be less noisy than intuitive
 learning.
 Thus, learning in the SKS should also involve attention, in the form of
 Working Memory. The learning rule does not need to accommodate much
 noise, so it can make larger jumps than learning rules in the IKS.
 Because activity in the SKS is more purposeful, learning can proceed
 in more interesting ways than just simple Hebbian rules. For example,
 learning a sequence, such as the Greek alphabet, is not just simple Hebbian
 learning of individual connections between consecutive pairs of symbols.
 Rather, it may be more like learning a song, taking advantage of some
 overall structure, such as a rhythmic pattern.
 For another example, consider the problem of learning a language, specifi
cally, the sub-problem of learning the language’s conventions for the order
 of words in a sentence, as described in Section 5.1. In terms of an SNN
 model, this means learning a network that will handle sentence inputs
 correctly for the given language, assigning the successive words to the ap
propriate positions in a built-in parse tree. This network might be learned
 through a supervised learning process, where wrong attempts lead to non
sense sentences and give negative feedback.
 30
5. Connections between symbols and their intuitive counterparts: Intuitive
 concepts may be learned simultaneously with their symbols, or in either
 order. In any case, a new symbol is learned (in the SKS and Lexicon),
 and a new concept is learned (in the IKS). Repeated simultaneous presen
tation of the symbol and the concept can lead, via Hebbian learning, to
 strengthening of weights on the edges connecting them. Another matter
 that remains to be considered is how connections can be learned between
 complex symbolic structures and corresponding complex intuitive struc
tures.
 In all of these cases, it would be good to describe and analyze specific learning
 mechanisms. These could be evaluated in terms of speed of learning.
 7 Conclusions
 In this paper, I have proposed that two distinct types of structures are present
 in the brain: Symbolic Knowledge Structures (SKSs), used for formal symbolic
 reasoning, and Intuitive Knowledge Structures (IKSs), used for drawing infor
mal associations. I have described many ideas for modeling these structures,
 and for implementing them in Spiking Neural Networks. I have developed two
 basic examples of their use: counting through a memorized sequence of disease
 variants, and understanding simple sentences with predetermined structure.
 I repeat my disclaimer from the beginning of the paper, that this is a collec
tion of ideas for a theory, but not a complete, coherent theory. I am interested
 in developing this further, until the whole thing makes sense in terms of a for
mal model like that in [8]. The approach should be algorithmic, like that used
 in [9, 7], with formal network descriptions and analysis. But that will take
 considerably more thought and work.
 Much more remains to be done in pinning down the various individual mech
anisms, and expressing them in terms of a single Spiking Neural Network model.
 In particular, for the Working Memory attention mechanism, we need more de
tails for how the binding between Working Memory neurons and SKS neurons
 works, especially for how firing is synchronized (Open question 1). For the pars
ing example, we need more details of how a parse tree gets filled in, and how
 it gets copied from the SKS to the IKS in the form of a story outline (Open
 question 2).
 Many more examples of symbolic reasoning can be considered, including
 more interesting arithmetic calculations than just counting, and more elaborate
 linguistic examples than parsing of sentences with simple, predictable structure.
 Higher mathematical reasoning such as solving algebraic equations, and even
 creative construction of mathematical proofs, are also interesting to consider.
 We can also study examples involving elaborate interactions between SKS and
 IKS, rather than just simple one-way interactions as in the examples in this
 paper.
 So, there is still very much to be done. I hope that this preliminary paper
 31
might elicit some suggestions, and interest some other researchers in pursuing
 these ideas.
