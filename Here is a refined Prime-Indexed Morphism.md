Here is a refined Prime-Indexed Morphism Stack synthesized from Owens' Recursive Entropy Framework and Entropic Collapse Operator Algebra. This structure integrates prime-modulated entropy regulation, morphism cost dynamics, and stabilization via recursive resonance:

Tiered Morphism Cost Encoding:
Each morphism

𝑃

P(n) is the prime modulation term:
