I only care about those who care about themselves and are taking action themselves those people I will travel
0:07
the country I will do free events I will sit there with them for hours I will rant and Rave and help and study and do
0:14
everything but if you're not somebody who cares about yourself and you're just letting it happen in a Derpy passive
0:19
State that's on you law of the jungle on your way to the end so the way that it
0:27
happens is you have something that you'd call the winner effect you can look up the winner effect look that up you never heard of it probably heard about in my
0:33
content and what happens is that you get I guess you might in a simple way a very oversimplified way called a dopamine
0:39
release when you're winning and what happens that when you're winning more people are when you're winning it
0:46
releases more happy chemicals when you have more happy chemicals it makes you act more confident and it makes you much
0:52
less needy and when you're more confident more funny more free associative more of a leader and less needy more people like you are attracted
1:00
to you want to work with you and want to take your lead and this is why you tend to go on upward spirals or downward
1:07
Spirals and you've got to begin to recognize when you're in a downward spiral and a bad enough downward spiral
1:14
the way that that can look like is you lose your job when you lose your job you
1:19
usually lose your partner okay when you lose your money you usually lose your partner but guess what it's not because
1:26
your partner was a gold digger they leave you not because of the money they leave you because how losing your
1:32
money affects your behavior and how it affects your confidence and it sickens them they leave because of that it's not
1:38
because of the money they would sleep with you under a bridge if you were just confident how do you know that cuz Club
1:44
promoters live on couches and they have no shortage of dates okay so they have delusional confidence as a club promoter
1:50
and and they're flat broke um the guys that I know that are the most successful in dating in LA are all broke and they
1:56
all live on couches so it has nothing to do with money they have delution confidence and they probably use cocaine
2:02
and between delusional confidence and their cocaine use they have a lot of confidence might not last them that long
2:08
when they die at 32 but up until 32 no one's leaving them so then what happens
2:14
your partner leaves you now you're in a state where you've lost your money you're and you're processing a breakup
2:19
which usually after breakup you're a mess for a month or two at least so now you're flat broke trying to get a new
2:24
job in the middle of a breakup or if you're single nobody wants to date you so now people are repelled from you that
2:31
there causes you to become very needy and to become a black hole as you become a black hole it begins to warp you at a
2:38
soul level and as you get weirder and weirder and weirder you put more people off and before you know it you're the
2:45
creepy man at Denny's in the middle of the night like with no teeth like hey
2:51
sunny and you and you and you you literally go so deep in the darkness that it warps your soul and now you're
2:57
the creepy old man at Denny's at 3 in the morning like who smells weird missing teeth and is just like looking
3:03
at people talking to them with no social calibration whatsoever you're that guy you because what happens that the black
3:09
hole becomes so brutal that eventually you just embrace the black hole you're like I am the black
3:14
[Applause] hole and as you just be and and you and
3:21
then you start getting power from being the black hole and and you join the Dark Side which then poisons your soul turns
3:27
you into total weirdo and it's like how did it even get to that point how did it get to that point what could have
3:33
possibly happened to get you there so um women have different problems in my view
3:39
uh different challenges um I'm going to say a challenge that that a lot of guys are annoyed by but I genuinely empathize
3:47
with I think it's a if I was a woman I would hate this okay I would hate this
3:53
so many and women are all different so I'm not going to generalize but I'm going to say a common problem I've seen with many women doesn't mean everybody
3:59
everyone has is different and their differences need to be respected but imagine that you're a woman and you
4:05
don't want to date a loser do you do you want to date a beta loser what do you want to do that when
4:13
your entire system is telling you this makes me sick like it's physically
4:18
sickening physically sickening the way eating feces is physically sickening so
4:25
you want to you want to date somebody who's a winner right but the thing that you have to understand understand is
4:30
that in men there is a tremendous fluctuation in the potency virility
4:40
value competency and ability to move the Earth of that
4:46
man you might be one man you might be 10 men you might be a men you might be a
4:53
million men that's actually true you might be one men like you know a in The
5:00
Iliad where Achilles can just take over an entire war zone himself you ever seen Troy the movie might God forbid you read
5:06
Homer's ilad but if you remember the movie Troy played by Brad Pit so just
5:11
like Achilles some men are 10 men some men are a 100 men why is it that some
5:18
men are a million men that's real by the way why are some men a million
5:24
men um really okay so life is in effect
5:30
a video game but a real life video game and some people play the game better
5:35
than others play the game some people understand the game better they have better reality testing so they're able
5:42
to see things they're able to see through all the B guys this is so crazy deep topic but it's they they can see
5:48
through all the veils of BS so so understand most information coming at you it there's been piss in the pot okay
5:56
so key key takeaway by by the time that the unwashed masses get
6:03
permission from The Gatekeepers to get the information the pot has been pissed
6:08
in by the agendas of the people controlling the information so by the
6:13
time that you get that information like you don't just get to get straight information okay I was able to give
6:20
straight information for a period of time I gave everything and then I
6:26
couldn't now as I sit here I can get you 50%
6:32
information I can get you half of what I know half I can get you about 50% what
6:39
happens if I go in the other 50% I I no longer can get you any information and none of you stood up for
6:46
that not one of you in a meaningful way you're just go go go like I'm a Marvel
6:53
movie character moving the whole world myself so I can get you about
7:01
half but you don't care you don't actually care I care you don't care I'm
7:09
mad you're not mad so you can get about half and like if you study clinical
7:18
NPD the waves and layers of BS that you're being fed by someone with
7:24
narcissism where it's like everything every bit of goodness that you have is exploited every word you say is reframed
7:33
every action you take is recontextualized every it's like they say everything you say say K and will be
7:38
used against you everything you do when someone's in that mindset will be warped and twisted and and straw manned in
7:45
order for that and that person there's no soul there there's a schizoid core and no actual Soul so what's happening
7:52
you know arguably right so what's happening is you can't reason with the person like hey stop this warping and de
7:58
demented Behavior because there's no one there to communicate to it's a shark dead in the
8:04
eyes it's a shark you can't tell the shark like hey let's reason with each other like let's let's talk you know I
8:09
could be a shark Rider we'll work collaboratively the shark just like just tries to eat you in a in a human form a
8:15
shark is somebody whose mind is in a completely transactional win-lose State
8:20
all the time so it's going to just warp and twist there's nothing there to guide it out of that kind of state these kind
8:26
of people have very very strong frames very very very confident because they are not weighed down with the ethical
8:33
condition uh uh thought process that you may have they're not playing the chess game with the same rules that you have
8:40
they just skip all the rules they don't care it's it's this machine that just does this okay so the people that
8:48
control the information many of them are in that mode and the things that they they will
8:54
warp they will take things that are good causes that are good things that are beautiful things that you believe in at
9:01
a level of passion that it's causes that speak to your soul at the deepest level
9:07
things that are so true and dear to you and they will use that to envelop it in
9:13
in a poison pill you know like like giving like giving a beautiful little teddy bear to a baby and the baby loves
9:20
that teddy bear so much and somebody had toxified the teddy bear and just sickeningly disgustingly hurt a child
9:27
that is what is done to adults with the information now if you doubt this simply walk down
9:33
the street and look to the extent that people are disassociated they're derealized disassociated depersonalized
9:40
they're in a freaking trance they're whacked out of their mind
9:46
and that is due to the information that they are consuming which then controls
9:51
Behavior which then controls the extent to which your mind is sharp and this just goes on and on
9:58
and on so why is why can one person be a million people well one of the first
10:03
things is they see through the lies they immediately they they just because they know how those people think and the key
10:12
is they're not jaded either they're not even mad at it they're not mad like
10:17
they're not they're not mad at it for themselves they're mad at it for all of
10:22
you but they're not mad at it for themselves because they see through it so easily it's it's a big joke it's
10:28
literally so dumb that when you see it you can't un seee it it's a joke but you're Maad you're you feel mad for the
10:34
people who don't see it that are sweet sensitive Souls that that are being led down the wrong path doesn't mean that
10:40
you know the exact right path but at least the intention is there so from
10:46
that standpoint you got to understand that you know one man can be a thousand men
10:53
because I'll just give a very simple example very simple there's so many more examples I'll give a simple one that's
10:59
aable the basic thing of like go to school get it you know go to college rack up a huge debt get a 50k your job
11:08
work until you retire all of that kind of all those kind of ideas somebody at a high level
11:15
sees right through that and you have to understand the the traps there's traps
11:21
upon traps upon traps upon traps upon traps upon traps upon traps because there's the Trap of the job okay now you
11:29
become a entrepreneur but then the next trap like simple traps would be that could be easily relatable but there's so
11:34
many deeper ones would be working in the business instead of on the
11:40
business right that would be a trap right like if I have staff
11:49
here that is only a win for them if they're learning skills that
11:55
they can then use to leave and build upon
12:00
but it's not a win for them if they're permanently in their job is
12:07
it now a a real win-win is when they
12:12
would be creating manuals texts and videos about everything that they
12:18
mastered and then they out of friendship to me would teach it to the next person before they would leave that's a win-win
12:25
right not leaving me in the Lurch but you know cuz I do win suffer them too and so that's a culture that I
12:31
create but it's not a win making making 500k a
12:38
year is not a win it's a trap you're being trapped at 500k a year
12:43
you're trapped at a million a year I'm just talking simple stuff like money there's so much like this is such
12:49
garbage everything I'm saying by the way it's so much garbage me talking about
12:55
money is a trap traps upon traps upon traps upon traps upon traps upon traps upon traps
13:03
me you caring about money is a trap you see that you have to go beyond
13:09
so it's traps upon traps upon traps so basic things like and I hate to say it
13:15
you know be a nice guy and you'll have a nice wife waiting for you and two kids in a pick a fence trap upon trap upon
13:23
trap upon trap upon trap it's a trap it's not real that is not real anymore
13:29
that's not how things actually work but I am trapped because if I show you and I
13:36
can I have can and will show you the
13:41
things that I will show you about the LIE of that are so incredibly shocking
13:46
and the programming is so incredibly intense of what you believe that if that what do they say about truth tellers and
13:52
not that I have the ultimate truth anyone says that's bsing but at least I'm trying at least the intention is
13:58
there at least the desire to be empirical is there so if I show that
14:04
like if if I showed you what I knew to the full extent about
14:09
that that's that's not something that can exist because it's a pimp ho
14:16
relationship it's a pimp hoe relationship you go to the hoe say your pimp is bad the hoe gets
14:23
mad we are in a hoe relationship with layers upon layers traps we give up our
14:31
agency and our individuality and our autonomy and our very soul in order to
14:37
make these these deals with the devil it's a deal with freaking Satan might be metaphorical might be
14:44
literal but it applies either way so why can one man be a thousand men
14:51
because he knows his BS he looks at this and he doesn't and he doesn't do what I'm doing here like
14:57
this is very beta what I'm doing right it's very beta male like needing to tell
15:03
you that you know that you're hose that's what a beta male does an alpha male just goes [ __ ] them and just
15:12
wins they go right they're just like they don't want to
15:17
change it's all good and then just wins they just do their thing they don't feel this need to Bang the Drum but people
15:24
who don't want to hear it will just get stressed and won't ultimately change they won't ultimately change so why tell
15:32
them they don't want to change so you know a talk like this is
15:38
not meant for all of you to hear it I'm I'm I'm thinking I make a talk like
15:44
this 50,000 people see it online five people get it the most the other amount clicks on clicks
15:52
off forgets about it doesn't care doesn't want to play the game at that level
15:59
but again why could one man be a thousand men because the traps upon traps upon
16:05
traps upon traps are obvious they're right in front of you and you just choose to see them so then you say okay
16:13
take it off take it off take it off off off off off off off off off off off off
16:19
off off off off what do I want what do I want now of a so simple
16:25
example that I gave real simple ones oh I'm working for somebody else that's a trap run a business oh wait a minute I'm
16:33
working in the business rather than on the business another trap boom remove that
16:42
now in a free Mar in a supposedly free market Society somebody who understands how to
16:49
play the game at that level has the ability to go beyond and Beyond and Beyond and Beyond and Beyond and make
16:57
billions of dollars and have Global influence so now let's go back to dating
17:04
you're going to choose to date somebody and you could date one man you could
17:09
date a thousand men you could date a million
17:15
men if you were a woman would you want to just date one man or do you want to
17:21
date a million men what would your biology be telling you what would
17:26
your you know what would your gut instin be telling you so the but the problem is it's a
17:34
metaphorical million men by the way you have this look on your face like you're imagining a [ __ ] okay like the
17:40
showering [ __ ] of a million men right you're like that's I just want one man Owen speaking metaphorically okay so a a
17:48
man because let's just break that down real simple Elon Musk income earning
17:54
potential how many men now that's just money Prett much all them what if what if it's somebody who
17:59
walks in a room and the whole room is centered around that man everything he says people just listen to it commands
18:06
rooms always has the most fun always doing the coolest stuff always just
18:11
living just winning you know being around that guy is just winning winning winning winning winning he just knows
18:18
how to play the game of life but the problem is when a guy knows how to play the game of Life probably not going to be
18:27
monogamous kind of sucks right because now you've dated dated a guy who knows how to play
18:35
the game of Life you've seen what that looks like right it's like you've gone to Avatar and now you got to watch a
18:41
black and white silent film I want more Avatar I don't want to
18:46
watch a black and white silent film but see somebody who is winning at the game of life is more
18:53
aware and so that's something that a lot of girls deal with is like they've most
18:59
women have dated a dated a very amazing
19:04
man but it's really really hard to retain that guy and by the way talk
19:10
about Lies Women are not taught to create
19:15
something of themselves that would even have a hope to retain somebody like that everything you're taught is to repel
19:22
somebody like that to repel them or another layer down to shame them into
19:30
not being that guy it's like uh you know you ever go to
19:35
Airbnb and you make a mess of it and by the time that you leave that Airbnb you
19:41
just hate it want to leave CU there's no made at the Airbnb so you just you just don't do your your
19:46
dishes you don't do the laundry so a week after Mak the Airbnb it's kind of a crap hole you want to leave you're the
19:51
one that messed it up and now you you don't like the Airbnb you did that so there's not there's no there's not
19:58
actually like how would a guy operating at that level has there ever even been discussion about how to create something
20:04
that that guy would want or that would add value to him well if there's and then and then a guy like that looks at
20:11
that and he's like can't tell him nothing I can't say anything because I'm the bad guy if I say anything I'm open
20:18
to monogamy but if I talk about what I'd even want and share my feelings I'll be shamed for that and in
20:26
the meantime I can have as much fun as I want so why and the only reason
20:32
eventually just becomes children but even the laws are set up in such a manner that is so dangerous for that guy
20:38
that it's he's like he's just looking at this like this is nuts so if I was a woman I would hate that so on one hand
20:45
you have men at risk of suicide and you have women having seen
20:53
Avatar but being forced to watch a to permanently watch a black and white no
20:59
uh audio movie okay for every girl that's been in
21:04
Drake's private plane how do you go back from that how do you go
21:12
back so there's a lot of weird Dynamics okay
21:18
that go on basically okay that men and women deal with that's Collective can't change the world can't save the world
21:25
you're one person um what you can do is you can sweep your own [ __ ] porch so what does that
21:30
mean if you're a man recognize the danger that you're in as far as um the
21:38
traps that you get into um by the way uh the billionaire thing is also a trap
21:45
too becoming a billionaire is also a trap I coach them they're my one-on-one
21:51
clients they're [ __ ] unhappy they're in a trap
21:58
so right look at what they look at what they've taken on they're in a trap traps upon traps upon traps upon
22:05
traps upon traps right so if I'm a woman what would I
22:12
do I would have an honest conversation with myself about exactly who I want and
22:18
I would ask myself to what extent I align with building and transforming myself into is something that would be a
22:24
no-brainer for that man what does that look like and if I don't want want to do it I don't have to but if I want to I'm
22:31
honest with myself right like when I do uh programs you know you guys take a trading with me I don't just get to do
22:37
what I want I have to also do what you want I can't just say my program is I
22:43
sit on my couch eating Cheetos that's what I want it has to be also what you want it has to be a win-win for both so from
22:52
that standpoint if I'm a woman I'm being honest about I'm profiling the guy that
22:58
I want to be the dad of my kids if I want kids or maybe I don't want kids I'm profiling him and I'm ask now I'm not
23:04
going to become so not myself that I hate myself to get that guy but I'm just like I wouldn't do a job that I hate but
23:11
I'm looking for a win-win between that and then I just say what's realistic and
23:16
then I go get it if I'm a man I would look at things like upwards and downward Spirals and I would realize that you're
23:23
in a lot more danger than you realize you um you can fall off so bad and some
23:31
people never come back okay once you get to a point that you've been that beaten down psychologically it is very very
23:37
hard to bounce back what you want to do instead is go on the other side of that coin and you know go boom all the way to
23:44
the other side of it and if you get to the other side of that coin then you get into a thriving position okay let me
23:50
give basic set standards demand okay every room you walk into absolute leader
23:56
or one of the leaders of a very small group Total Access to almost everything
24:01
ability to get whatever it is that you want understanding of BS understanding
24:07
of systems understanding how to play the game like a video game player massive awareness of your time how time is being
24:13
used where time and energy is going and seeing everything as a suck on
24:20
your energy and time it's all a bunch of fake phony
24:26
Liars all of it 99.9% of what you're encountering is
24:31
fake phony Liars okay let me show you simple examples okay let me show you how
24:37
I see it okay so I have a vision of exactly what it is that I want to
24:42
build I have drilled down very very deeply on the details the specifics now
24:48
I'm not so rigid that I can't evolve and change it we all change we grow but I drill down on that then what I do is I
24:54
look at how I'm runting my day now by the way that in of itself is this tremendous job because you don't even
25:02
know what you want your life to look like because let's say you're more business oriented you're like oh I want to run this big business why
25:11
why money why how do I see through the LIE of this because I coach
25:17
multi-millionaires and billionaires unhappy miserable all the money in the world miserable like you know what
25:24
genuinely makes you happy not the LIE of what what you're told makes you happy by
25:30
a self-help Guru saying I'll show you the way to make money and be
25:35
happy you should look at me with total complete skepticism and
25:41
cynicism I blame down frames saying oh here's how you make a million dollars you should be skeptical of me why might
25:49
I be telling you to go make a million dollars oh CU I know how so now you Tak
25:54
my course now you're my fan so you should to yourself okay I'm open-minded
26:00
I would not hear if I'm close-minded but why is he telling me this will that actually make me happy and then you've
26:06
got to look inside yourself well when I've had you know how much money makes me the most happy now they'll say oh you
26:13
have a limiting belief if you don't want to make the most money lies because you die you should be for
26:20
100 to make that much cash takes time so to be a effective video game player of
26:25
real life you've got to know okay well if I use this much time effectively I make this much and how much do I need to
26:31
have the life that I want somebody who made a billion dollars is probably over optimized they're like the Ronnie
26:37
Coleman or Jay Cutler of money like all you know but like all stiff and tight they don't need that much cash that's
26:43
not necessary oh that's the limiting belief just find a way to make it lies lies lies lies it's all
26:52
lies you don't need that much money only if you love it for your own reasons it's
26:58
not cuz you were told to love it someone says oh it's lazy they say oh
27:03
how you do one thing is how you do everything is that true how you do one thing how you do everything no it's just
27:08
sort of true kind of like in some cases not Universal it's like the Law of Attraction oh what what energy is in you
27:16
you'll manifest outside yourself it's often true it's not always true I see negative people witting I see positive
27:21
people dying it's not always true it's just often true it's a good idea Law of Attraction it's not 100% true so lies
27:29
upon lies you're being sold a dream so you've got to pull back from that dream you've got to say to yourself okay well
27:35
if I'm sold that dream how do I pull back and begin to audit that dream and
27:41
really understand what I like see most of you here if I got you a week off you
27:46
wouldn't even know what to do with it if I gave you a vacation to Hawaii for free
27:52
you just act how you're acting at work but in Hawaii it's just a change of
27:58
scenery you'd be in the same state cuz you're addicted to it so you've got to start asking yourself okay what is it
28:04
that I want healthwise resource wise lifestyle wise happiness wise
28:10
spiritually emotionally you got to start digging that out and not just on other people's agenda what they tell you not
28:18
mine not advertising not you being a polar responder arguing just because you want
28:25
to but you then what you have to do is you have to
28:31
look you like let me show you how I see a room like this if you want to enter into my world okay I see you as a room
28:36
of potential and a beautiful souls but I see it like
28:41
this um I see my staff as people who love me want to help me and love my
28:47
mission but I also see that because they're humans they will sit there derping and spaced out unless I actively
28:55
get them to wake up that's how I see my staff I see you in
29:00
this room as here because on some shred of willpower that I probably half pumped
29:07
into you by hammering you for months to be here and you you got yourself into a
29:13
room great job you made it into a
29:19
room I'm so proud and the sad part is I am what does
29:25
that say about my expectations for you so you got yourself into a room I think
29:30
that you're barely able not to look at your phone I think you're barely able to retain anything I'm
29:36
saying I think most of you are tourists and dabblers I think most of you will be
29:42
more focused on getting a photo with me out there than doing what I say I think most of you are not serious
29:49
about your own lives and I think that you philosophically align with the idea
29:54
of improving your life but are unwilling to take the steps to do so I don't think
30:00
that you want to change I don't think that you're committed to change and I think that
30:06
through my bizarre wizard stories that I can do here that I can get five or 10%
30:12
of you to begin slightly to start kind of like a the
30:19
bottom of your drain of your bath where it kind of just makes its own little thing there like a little flywheel and
30:26
so I'm in here trying to go eh like you're like little dles you know and I'm trying to get some little start
30:32
you know like starting a a a propeller so I'm trying to make you mad and I'm
30:37
trying to Bandy stuff in front of your brain and and kind of smack you like like a like a dead body that you're
30:43
pumping electricity into and the problem is is that I am
30:51
forced to talk to you like a baby so even though the larger truth of your life that would be more important to you
30:57
is more relevant if I talk about those larger truths it's too outside of your context or frame of reference so as a
31:05
result I have to be like I have Hollywood Hills
31:10
mansion money dating look at girl in
31:16
bikini like an animal okay that's how marketers view
31:22
you by the way you study marketing they train you view the people you're marketing you as an animal primitive
31:28
base level spaced out autopilot unconscious hypocritical
31:35
lying and that you mark it from there so and and if you resist this
31:42
watch your bank account drained
31:47
so that's how I see it I see it like most people in the room not serious
31:53
staff not serious people on the street not serious spaced out low-level
32:01
thinking self-deceptive
32:07
hose and and Lord hoe being giving away Agency for a
32:13
trinket giving away Agency for a trinket a little
32:20
trinket every time you eat a bag of Cheetos you're a hoe poisoning yourself for little taste
32:28
and texture on a tongue that's what they think about you you guys you can't even buy healthy
32:35
food at an airport or a hospital your kids are born at a beautiful Hospital you you have to go
32:42
get go get them uh or like go get the mom of your kids Taco Bell there's a t
32:48
the place of healing the food is Taco Bell no one
32:53
cares there's no will to change it we're space out
33:01
so what is it what would it take you know to reverse that what does that even take what would
33:08
be involved in reversing that well right up the bat in the way a hoe would defend
33:13
her pimp you know you try to change it hey leave my pimp
33:21
alone you you you you poke your head up boom chopped off
33:28
and there's endless ways to chop that head off because every person is not
33:34
perfect so all that you have to do is just dig into them fight a couple things boom get rid of them you just dig in
33:42
what they say there's phones everywhere recording everything what they say what they do wrong gone the way to think
33:50
about it is like a forest and you know say you're in the redwood forest and some of these trees are crazy tall and
33:57
they're blocking the light of all those other little species under underneath you know and if you say hey big tree
34:03
chop yourself down so the other plants can get light the big tree ain't
34:10
listening now a whole ecosystem can grow underneath
34:16
insects cockroaches worms do you self-identify as a redwood
34:23
forest tree or do you self-identify as a worm a cockroach
34:28
an insect where are you in that equation be have an honest conversation with yourself about it these are
34:34
conversations I have with myself guess where I self-identify
34:39
myself worm that's the truth I mean do you
34:46
consider yourself like that as one I think areas of your life I think the
34:51
conditioning is so deep that I'm one of the earlier people
34:57
to begin to understand how bad it is I'm like a worm that's like hello fellow
35:06
worms we're worms you know right like I'm not the tree bro okay I saw the water I I Saw My
35:16
Reflection this is what we are yeah that's what I saw who is the
35:21
tree I can only tell you 50% so there's your answer okay so
35:29
so look so so here's the thing okay look the sad part is it's it's even more the answer is even more disgusting than that
35:35
right because the very people that are benefiting the most are are as unhappy as the most as as the hose the pimp is
35:43
also sick in the head the pimp is sick in the head the hoe is sick in the head
35:49
the whole dynamic is twisted and sick n no there's no Dynamic where the
35:56
pimp is just as happy go-lucky healthy person the dynamic is the sick
36:03
part so look the system runs so deep that the
36:08
only real way to win is to pull yourself out of it completely but um and there's a lot of pragmatic components of that
36:14
too but you want to be if if you examine your life and you you just realize that
36:20
people are spaced out they have their gods their version of God is the little
36:26
ways that they sell themselves out selling yourself out comes in the form of a thought instead of being present it
36:32
comes in the form of thinking bad at people rather than being present to boost yourself
36:38
up it comes in the form of what you put in your body comes in the form of how you use your habit it's anything that goes
36:46
counter to the life that you want to live and the person that you want to be is selling yourself
36:52
out so and and it's anything that isn't honestly auditing with total honesty and
36:59
thoroughly what it is that you're trying to get out of life okay really really like it's a lot
37:05
remember I told you how I run these events it's a lot of math it's a lot of auditing it's a lot of math and it's a
37:12
lot of backwards engineering but they got you so trumped up on your day-to-day grind getting to work getting home and
37:20
staying above water that you don't get a chance to see what it means to truly fly and the layers upon layers upon
37:26
layers of what it takes to truly fly are so crazy because I've been fortunate in
37:32
the sense that I've had the chance to take off work if I want until the day I die and so I'm able to pause and say
37:41
maybe I don't want to work for three or four years so I did that I didn't really work for several years and I really
37:48
delved into like what does it actually mean to thrive here's what I found I didn't know where to spend the
37:56
money once I found things that I want to spend the money on I'd go to these places but my state of mind and emotions
38:04
weren't that different than when I worked because the sheer trauma the
38:10
blunt force trauma that you undergo to get
38:15
ahead changes you to where you're so dialed in on
38:21
making things happen and taking massive action and a lot of people being difficult to deal with and a lot of bad stuff that it's hard to just be in a
38:28
forest and laugh I had to train myself like a student to be in a forest and
38:35
laugh so imagine how dumb I feel teaching a personal growth course and
38:41
I'm saying oh you can make money knowing that for those of you that make a lot of
38:46
money you'll be no happier because I haven't figured
38:51
out you know here's what here's what I found you
38:57
get the the money to go do what you want to do but you you haven't really thought it
39:04
through you haven't thought it through how you would even do it so say that say for example you want
39:10
to go somewhere you probably don't even know how to properly travel you don't even know how to set up the logistics to
39:16
it you don't even know how to plan something it took me taking off about half a decade close to half a decade it
39:24
took me several years to even learn the logistics to doing what I want to do like say for example You Want to Start
39:30
Skydiving oh I think that'd be cool skydiving but how many years away from learning to skydive like how much time
39:38
do you have to even spend skydiving till it gets fun the first big chunk of it is just researching where to even do it then
39:44
you've got to research what's involved in it then you got to research where to go then you got to go get the lessons
39:50
then you got to go do the initial jumps that aren't even Fun by the time that you get to the like think about it this
39:55
way okay by the time that you reach a point where you're doing a Skydive the amount of stress and hours
40:01
that you had to put in to learn about it to get the logistics down to find out where the place is to pay all the fees
40:08
to get up to fly up into the air for that one little jump the
40:14
ratio it's like I don't know s what we say is the ratio of like hours put in for that one jump It's you're packing
40:22
parachutes you got to be up in the plane going up for like half an hour for about
40:27
seconds jump and you're doing this again and again and again and the skyd locations are usually a couple hours
40:32
away from the city because they got to be out the countryside so yeah it's it's a lot of time energy cost for that one
40:38
little jump and then you got to do jump after jump after jump to make so yeah so
40:43
I'm G to go make all this money so I can Skydive but it takes you years to even get to the point that you can even enjoy
40:49
the jumps and then after that you know what you realize it didn't even work
40:57
it wasn't you like a kid again smiling and laughing jumping if anything you're so stressed
41:04
by the number of years it took to make the money the number of years it took to get good at it to learn the logistics by
41:10
the time you do it you're like this better be good so it doesn't even
41:20
work so how do you get out of the Trap there's layers
41:27
simple say you got better at dating right learn about the dating ideas go take the course go out approach reject
41:35
work at it day twos phone calls BL out blah you know so for 10 10 minutes you
41:41
go H through a
41:48
condom right ah it's like courses work approaches
41:56
rejections call calls DMs like blah blah blah blah blah and you're just
42:08
like so it's like just enough of a it's like you're being breadcrumbed by
42:14
biology in reality just breadcrumbed right it's like a little breadcrumb just like a pellet to just keep the the
42:20
hamster running through like it's like you notice that even something like an orgasm is like just the minimum minimum
42:27
minimum effective dose of pleasure to keep you running through that rad race right like it's just good
42:32
enough if it was even 5% thoughtless good you'd give up you know what I mean right but it's
42:39
like just enough that you remember how good it felt and it just enough that you want to keep going
42:45
so this is what it means to like but but unfortunately due to the rat race we we
42:51
don't really get the opportunity to drill in on life of what it is that we want at a high level we're kind of in
42:56
this uh kind of trap okay now what I'm talking about here is trap
43:06
removal level Numero Uno which is like the money the
43:13
confidence some dating things like that that's trap level
43:18
one but at every trap level there's another trap
43:24
so for most of you in this room you don't the the higher level traps you don't relate to now by the way do you
43:30
want me to give you a hint of the higher level traps a hint your will has been
43:37
hijacked and you have no soul okay let's go back to making some
43:43
money now okay so no but by the way I'm messing with you I'm messing with
43:50
you how much do you control your thoughts not as much as barely you
43:57
barely have control over your own mind so when I say to you you're a soulless
44:02
empty vessel without control of your mind you go no I'm not I got a soul I'm
44:08
not an empty vessel but if you're spaced out not able
44:15
to control your mind and easily manipulated then what does that mean does you making money and you getting
44:21
your social skills or dating life or you being a bit happier sorted out does that get you out of the Trap that you're that
44:28
easily manipulated still a puppet you're still a
44:34
puppet so there's a trap there traps after traps after traps
44:40
after traps after traps so by the way being bitter about that is
44:48
what being unhappy about that is what tra it's all trap unless you the Alpha
44:54
and the Omega yourself I can't understand you because you're talking too quiet so speak up said
45:00
unless you are the alpha or the Omega yourself you're going to be in that track yeah but it's all hypothetical
45:07
because I'm not that so we're talking about ideals that me as the teacher hasn't reached and you haven't reached
45:12
none of us have but in reality it's not actually that hard it's just about starting a conversation all we have to do is start
45:19
a conversation that's not a common conversation wake up a little bit boom
45:25
we get out the Trap nice you see what I'm saying absolutely
45:30
yeah it's just it's just the point of being aware of it like oh okay I see what's happening cool how can I outthink
45:38
this how can I think Beyond this that's all that it really is you can absolutely do that any one of these things we're
45:43
talking about something it's not some impossible thing to get out of it's all very very possible but let let me tell you a little bit about how I kind of
45:49
became aware of this um during covid I couldn't run seminars and I couldn't teach in Social Gatherings anymore so
45:56
I'm sitting there with the barrel of the gun because I'm going to have to fire all my staff I didn't want to have to fire everybody right cuz I don't know
46:02
you know they're going to keep you know 15 days to stop the spread
46:07
so okay so knowing that I started doing one-on-one coaching with Rich guys and
46:12
all I did for two years was pound the phones of the of the Uber Rich so I got
46:18
to see what these people that were aspiring for how they think what they do
46:23
what they deal with now the obvious bias here is that people that are seeking out coaching are people that obviously are
46:29
maybe a little bit more unhappy but I saw what it looks like and I saw it I'm like oh wow so even at that income level
46:35
you're still screwed so I started thinking very very differently I was like wow that's really
46:40
crazy I've seen it with people that are amazing at dating and that often they're unhappy so that's you know I've seen it
46:46
with myself with half a decade off work and being like wow I I'm I'm really not
46:52
that like my life without working doesn't feel that different I I don't even know what to do with the money I
46:58
don't know how to spend it what do I do with it now when you're broke you know you're like Cry Me a River [ __ ] you
47:05
know Owen Cry Me a River but it's actually worse than you think why do you think people like you know say it's
47:11
Eminem or people like that get all the cash and they start turning to drugs because at least when you're in
47:17
the hamster trap in the hamster maze you're kind of running through the maze right what happens when you get to the middle of the Maze and there's nothing
47:23
there still empty it's very depressing you know he has songs about it like it
47:29
was more fun to it was more fun to fight to get famous than it was to be famous that's why a lot of them turned to drugs
47:35
and overdose because they they're at least when you're running through the maze the hamster maze you're saying to yourself okay well the cheese is going
47:41
to be awesome the cheese is going to be awesome you you're kind of dodging through things you're being manipulated you're a rat and a maze but at least
47:47
there's a purpose when you finally get to the point that you have it and you realize that you've because in the
47:53
entrepreneurial journey to get to the point of Financial Freedom you you see very dark truths about human
48:00
nature that you can't unsee so you can never see people the same again then as you see those dark truths about human
48:05
nature you start seeing it in yourself and you feel sick with yourself and see feel sick with where your brain's going
48:11
and you see what a worm you are you see the warm other people are that's when you start digging up the seron on the mount about forgiveness and just
48:18
literally being like I forgive others I forgive myself and you know you have to go
48:24
through that journey and then you got to learn how to even out fun but I did train myself to do it it takes it took
48:30
me 3 to 5 years of really learning how to spend the money to even figure out
48:36
how to have like real fun now when I'm talking fun don't come back at me some BS like well you know I have fun like
48:41
you know doing this or that I'm talking like the kind of fun that you envision if you go through the grind of all this
48:47
you know like you're envisioning something pretty awesome right I'm not saying you can't have some fun a video game is fun joke with your friends is
48:52
fun go say on Comedy is fun I'm not saying it's like a there's no fun at all but I'm talking the kind of fun that you
48:57
know you would imagine like if you went through it to Helen Back to build something like you do something really cool but it's really not that different
49:04
but I was able to find the most amazing life I really did I found the most amazing life and and I'm still
49:10
discovering that now I get it now but it took me half a decade it took me half a decade of barely working maybe working a
49:16
month or two a year to actually have fun you want why I stopped because I realize
49:22
this isn't going anywhere and I also realize that what I'm teaching is [ __ ] because I'm teaching people how
49:28
to how to build something they're not even going to like that really bothered me you know
49:37
I'm teaching people to be these people on the other end of the phone that's what I'm
49:44
teaching to become this this is what I'm working to become
49:51
so there so there's a lot of like sort of levels of abstraction now people hate this
49:57
because if you're already lost last thing you want to hear is that even the path that you had isn't proper
50:04
but it's not as hard to break out of as you'd think it's just about better conversations it's about better thought
50:11
processes so let's review some of them we've gone abstract let's review some of them Step One is you've got to audit
50:18
exactly what it is that you want and not just like well I just want all the money that's so [ __ ] boring and basic and
50:26
unoriginal you know it's like uh I don't know it's like
50:32
um it's like buying a Gucci shirt you know you're like okay I'm ready to spend some money on fashion so
50:38
you buy this like sweatshirt like graphic tea with the word Gucci on the
50:44
front for $1,000 like the safe Gucci shirtt I got
50:50
a couple Gucci shirts but they're ones that that I thought were like the rare pick of the bunch you know like the really interesting ones right but like
50:55
that taste person with no real taste or soul and they just say oh how do I how
51:02
do I look good Louis Vuitton and it's just like this big
51:08
logo that's somebody that says I just want to be rich no originality no
51:14
connection to what they really
51:19
want so rather than doing the graphic t000
51:25
Gucci shirt version of what you want dig a little bit deeper inside yourself and say what do I actually
51:33
want so for example I don't want a mega yacht why well if it was just handed to
51:42
me that's a fun yacht to have but how many decades of my life had to be
51:49
sacrificed if I live to be 80 I I hope to live longer but who knows do I want to spend a full extra decade doing
51:56
repetitive difficult task to be on a extra large boat or can I spend
52:07
$400 out of Seattle to get a giant cruise boat with
52:13
slides on it for my kids and go-karts for $400 and take a boat into
52:21
Alaska why do people need to own the boat ego
52:27
it's a justifier for why they did what they did it's a
52:33
justifier okay it's a way to justify misery there's an entire cottage
52:39
industry on helping people that made too much money justify doing what they did
52:46
truffle mushrooms the dumbest products ever
52:55
made you ever had a truffle mushroom so these dogs hunt the
53:01
Truffle and they go to Helen Back to get a truffle mushroom the Truffle mushroom
53:06
tastes no better than a shitake mushroom and probably has less nutrients but
53:12
because a rich person has been to Hell and back they say I can have the Truffle mushroom you
53:18
can't let me give another example I was in uh Denali Park in Alaska and Denali Park is beautiful but
53:26
it's about a 90 Mile Road in towards the base of mountain but there was a road there was a road collapse about mile 45
53:33
and so what happened was um they still run the tours because they want to make money and it's called the nature tour
53:39
right but the the animal life doesn't start to come in until around the place that the road collapsed so they called a
53:45
nature tour so I didn't know that the road had collapsed so I was in Alaska so I go on this bus
53:50
tour and it's called a nature tour and they stop and look at a
53:58
squirrel they say here's a squirrel and the people go ooh a
54:04
squirrel they go here's a crow they stop the bus and look at a
54:11
crow and people look at it because they're told to CU they're the Gucci shirt people right so they're told to
54:18
and then and then they there's this weird random Hill that's not that like
54:24
it's smaller of a view than any mountain that you'd see driving to Denali from
54:29
Anchorage and they and it's the picture area and people get out of the bus at the end and take pictures in front of
54:36
this Random Hill because they're told that's the place to take the picture with anybody who has critical
54:43
thinking they look like fools but everybody's doing it and the group think enables it while people make money from
54:49
it I happen to fly into Denali that was a hell of an experience
54:54
so I did that later so what happens is we're told what we're supposed to like and then we just
55:01
consume it I mean when you're not in a derp State and
55:08
you're being told to stare at a squirrel you came to Alaska and spent that money to look at a squirrel and a bird like a
55:16
crow like some nasty crow that you'd see eating your garbage a squirrel that you
55:21
see coming out of your of your like garbage can at home and you're told that it's crazy
55:28
czy so those people have not really thought
55:34
about what makes them happy they're not thinking about it going for the mega yacht for most people
55:40
is not really thinking what would make you happy can you save that time and get the
55:46
same outcome yeah you can still go do you like do you really like being on a giant
55:52
boat if you do how do you make that happen there's ways to get onto a giant boat now if you tell me I want to go on
56:00
a giant boat because I'm running a big company and I'm using it to network if you say to me I happen to stumble into a
56:08
highly lucrative industry and I have a giant boat because I can then yeah I think that doesn't make sense but not if
56:15
it's not what you really want for most of us that's not what we really want you're the graphic T Gucci shirt
56:22
wearer people that tell me I I want to be super duper jacked okay you're super duper
56:29
Jacks but is that what you really
56:35
want guys will always talk about all the sex they want to have but that's not what they want most guys want
56:42
companionship but they're told they should want all the sex is that what you really want so you
56:49
got to start looking into that these are the first layers of the Trap level one is just understanding
56:57
what it is that you really want what is it that makes you really happy what kind of occupations do you thrive in where
57:05
are your strengths what do you really like to do you have to have honest conversations
57:11
with yourself do I want to sell out for the money which is not a bad idea if it if if if it's the right opportunity or
57:17
do I want to do something I love by the way very good arguments to sell out for the money I don't but there's good
57:23
arguments to do it not everybody's to be a public speaking life coach
57:29
so very good reasons to do that for a lot of people I happen to be lucky to
57:34
suble to something I really love not everybody gets that so you got to start auditing that
57:40
okay so it's a lot of auditing a lot of self-awareness a lot of self- understanding a lot of digging a lot of
57:47
soul searching because otherwise you don't have a North star you're this boat going without any kind of a North
57:53
star for you know for women here like I look at you I don't think you like
57:59
dating losers I see it in your pupils you hate it I can see it when I when I talk about it I see the resentment and
58:06
disgust towards losers you like losers as people but you don't want them
58:13
inseminating you the vision of a loser inseminating you makes you physically sick I understand okay but then that
58:23
revulsion what that's meant to do is to motivate you to do a deep audit of what
58:30
it would mean to be a partner for someone who is not that how many hours have you spent in the head of a
58:37
man that you would want to be a partner for how many hours have you spent in their head like thinking what they
58:46
want good answer would be about 5 to 10,000 hours yeah sure have you done that a lot I mean I have you spent 5 or
58:53
10,000 hours auditing the psychology of the kind of person that you'd want to be a partner for no it's time to get
59:01
started right because if you don't someone else
59:06
will how many hours have I spent thinking about what I taught up here this
59:14
weekend couple 40 50,000 so you know I would guess right
59:21
because uh they say $10,000 of Mastery I'm probably somewhere around 20,000 hours of
59:26
work on this but I'm thinking about it all the time so you know so it's like I
59:32
mean I have clients that pay me the price of a house per hour well why do they pay me
59:40
that cuz I spent 20,000 hours thinking of how to help them so it's it there's a
59:45
Roi there's a winwin right so there there's no entitlement you're not owed anything no
59:50
one owes you anything um you know if you guys see me in a nightclub it's it's like watching a Marvel
59:57
Superhero it's psycho like it's just it's like watching a Marvel Superhero
1:00:02
well where did that come from 20 30,000 hours thinking how does this work you know I don't even and I
1:00:09
don't think you need that much time I think I can teach you in a weekend but that's why I create value so you know I save you that time
1:00:18
creating great products and services comes down to putting more time into solving a problem than other people do
1:00:24
and then that's what gives you that edge so put in that time into thinking what
1:00:31
you actually want what does a happy life look like for me okay can I tell you a little bit about I'll tell you a bit about my life
1:00:38
as an example okay I want to live a life where I get to um do the following
1:00:47
things I want to become more and more awake and present every year more
1:00:52
agentic more autonomous more SK
1:00:58
and in a metaphorical sense but not real sense cuz I don't believe in the in the real sense entirely but in a
1:01:04
metaphorical sense I'm more enlightened I'm not enlightened by the way
1:01:10
okay if you ever thought that so but I want to become more
1:01:15
metaphorically enlightened okay now from
1:01:22
there I I love traveling so I want to travel as much as I
1:01:28
can I want to bring my kids with me as much as I can I want to do work that builds skill
1:01:35
set and adds lasting value um but I would also say I care
1:01:41
about social change and I also understand that I'm
1:01:46
willing to say things that other people aren't and that I identify more with the
1:01:53
post-death Legacy than I do with lifetime success and that's
1:02:00
weird and that gets you in trouble and it doesn't serve you but I
1:02:06
care more about that so I these are things that I care about
1:02:13
now that would be at the surface that's the basics the greater things that I care
1:02:20
about are control of my own mind control of my own thoughts thoughts control of
1:02:27
my own State control of my own awareness ability to access Transcendent
1:02:34
States independently ability to be at the ca not the effect and I tend to see things
1:02:41
almost like you have this invisible ball in you that's your Core Essence and how
1:02:46
is that growing as well so what that means is that as
1:02:53
you're moving through life you're actually living living because you're doing you're you're living you're you're
1:02:59
living in a way where you're not on somebody else's agenda you're not on somebody else's
1:03:06
will what percent would you even say that you're in your own will right
1:03:12
now it's Madness how bad it is what does it matter if you make all the money in
1:03:18
the world if you don't even have a will what does it matter if you have all the
1:03:23
dating life or success in the world if you don't even have discernment if you can't even see the
1:03:29
world correctly if you don't even know who you are these are larger questions that one
1:03:37
has to deal with as you move up through the chain As you move up through the traps I'll tell you another thing too
1:03:44
you want to get real weird when you're dumb the Bible looks like the most
1:03:51
amazing thing in the world when you're very intelligent the
1:03:57
Bible looks like the dumbest thing in the world and when you hit a Transcendent point in your
1:04:02
Evolution the Bible is the most intelligent thing in the world but you're seeing it
1:04:09
completely different that book freaks me out man the Bible freaks
1:04:16
me out it freaks me out you dig through that thing from a more awake
1:04:24
perspective it will freak you out okay like you you learn how to read that
1:04:32
thing not as a derper okay like Noah's Arc okay not as a derper but you learn
1:04:39
how to read the esoteric code behind that thing you will cry and cry and cry
1:04:47
your hands will shake you might throw up if if you're not crying handshaking and
1:04:53
on the verge of vomiting because you're systens being hit so hard when you read the Bible you don't understand it you
1:04:59
don't get it that thing is like having an electric
1:05:04
current bam jumped in you and just your hair is on fire and your whole life is
1:05:10
turned upside down if you know how to read it I'm not going to sit and do a sermon
1:05:16
I'm not a preacher but I'd encourage you to realize like there's a lot of old
1:05:21
wisdom that has been wiped over and you're so so in your version of life and
1:05:27
so in your own little narcissistic self good delusion so disconnected and just
1:05:33
so messed up and when you start to see some of that older wisdom at a different level and I'm not just talking like do
1:05:41
nice to neighbor like I'm talking Core Essence level powerful powerful powerful
1:05:49
powerful deep ideas in there but not at the level that your weird neighbor is talking about who doesn't get it at all
1:05:55
all doesn't get it at all and is kind of an a cult but if you but by the way the cult
1:06:03
is there to block you from the wisdom it's a another trap it's the it's it's the way that you
1:06:11
um uh I'll get a little bit more Niche with you here it's an attack Vector okay
1:06:16
so let's go a bit off Topic attack vectors are there's a war of ideas okay
1:06:24
and attack vectors are places that ideas can be attacked okay so as an example um
1:06:30
a common like like people that know information Warfare get all this okay like say for example that uh a person
1:06:36
hates Bernie Sanders right remember Bernie Sanders so you go into his
1:06:41
followers and one of them in there is going to be some Hardline nasty communist then what you do is you get a
1:06:48
video of that guy talking and then you represent that as birdie Sanders followers that's an attack Vector okay
1:06:55
um in uh so I'm going to show ones that that the right use against left first um another one would be um you have
1:07:02
Progressive ideology and there's a whole range of ideas and then you try
1:07:07
different attack vectors so what's like what is currently the primary attack Vector on leftism just currently right
1:07:13
now Drag Brunch what's that Drag Brunch uh it would be uh drag queen Story Time
1:07:19
and uh um uh uh uh gender change of school gender
1:07:24
affirmation and change school right so you can if you go after the entire Progressive ideology that's ineffective
1:07:32
that's not an effective attack Vector so you pick at it and you find this kind of one little area that's sort of a
1:07:38
vulnerability in it and then you go to town on it like you're breaking through a door and you just pick at that thing
1:07:44
again and again and again even mischaracterize it now likewise left
1:07:49
left people going after Republicans there's also many many attack vectors that you can see on MSN NBC
1:07:56
you can see it on CNN they'll do entire hoaxes and entire
1:08:01
fullon hoaxes fullon government sponsored where taxpayer money is going
1:08:07
into like fake investigations just as a hoax as an attack Vector it's not a real dialogue
1:08:14
it's not it's not a real discussion it doesn't serve the voters it's just an attack Vector so
1:08:22
there there's ways in which you know the the dissemination of ideas um gets filtered through to you and and is and
1:08:27
you're connecting to those right so a simple example would be with deep level spiritual work the attack vectors the
1:08:34
followers who look so stupid it becomes the attack
1:08:40
Vector you know you like eart tole profound wisdom in The Power of Now the book The Power of Now what's the average
1:08:46
follower look likey you know right so anybody of intelligence looks at that they see the
1:08:51
followers say I don't want to become that so that's an attack vector
1:08:56
you know you had your your weird cousin is like Jesus my Lord and Savior right
1:09:01
you're like I don't I'm not becoming that right or you see it at the level of
1:09:08
story story and then you get into a discussion about story want to know another attack Vector in
1:09:13
Christianity um do you have total utter faith in Jesus Christ do you believe he
1:09:19
was real now that doesn't sound like an attack Vector but here's the thing
1:09:27
does somebody even have the right to even ask that question if they're not living
1:09:32
it that's not the right question the right question is what does
1:09:37
this mean to you tell me for 10 hours what this means to you break down for 10
1:09:43
or 12 hours what you got out of this and then break down for 50 hours how this
1:09:48
changed your life and how this change your behavior when we're done let's talk about what you just brought up then
1:09:55
we'll talk but so it becomes a block to internalization of the
1:10:03
principles so you know an attack attack vectors on us let me say my stuff um you
1:10:09
know we have this thing where what we teach is that the uh the words don't matter as much as the energy so we would do a example of that where you might
1:10:16
walk up and do a cold approach you say hey I like salad that's an example right we do that as a thought experiment to
1:10:22
show that the words don't matter an attack vector would be Owen says that the best way to get a date is to say I
1:10:28
like salad no that's not what I said I said it's little experiment but they can't do that right another attack
1:10:34
Vector is that I believe that when you um bring people to the front of the room you uh kind of like beat up on them a
1:10:40
little bit create pain around a weak identity and rebuild a strong identity Pablo at the back of the room went viral
1:10:48
with like 3040 50 million views because I gave him a hard time I gave him a hard time
1:10:55
Pablo changes life and his girl that you see pass out beside him is 9 months
1:11:05
pregnant what do you do when you say that someone's 9 months pregnant
1:11:10
congratulations okay so okay so right but but but you can reframe
1:11:18
what I'm doing as just this craz man yelling at somebody so these are these
1:11:24
are attack right so by the time that you even get the information you've had
1:11:29
political pissing in the okay the left has put in their agenda into the information the rights has put their
1:11:35
agenda into the information the businesses have put their inform have put their agenda into the information there's been attack vectors on the
1:11:42
information you're not able to get something you're not able to drink water which is
1:11:48
clean you go to sources of water that are clean and they're shrouded with weird followers
1:11:56
so where you you know so what do you do you go to internet
1:12:04
Guru you know what I mean right me you know you're in trouble when
1:12:09
you're listening to me you know what I mean this guy you're
1:12:14
in deep [ __ ] I'm your Guru you're
1:12:21
[ __ ] you're [ __ ] so
1:12:26
okay you're that [ __ ] I'm just messing with you guys right now so okay so nobody I mean it's true if you think
1:12:33
about it right I I start to become sick with this whole thing because um even the relationship that I
1:12:42
have to the people who I work with I I think is often Twisted it's makes me physically sick like looking at me as
1:12:50
some kind of an authority rather than a resource I'm a resource I'm not a
1:12:55
Authority I'm a resource so
1:13:01
um I'm giving you a lot of abstract ideas here I'm spitballing remember I told you part of why I do free tours is the spitball ideas so I'm kind of
1:13:07
spitballing here right someday I'll make this talk more cohesive and I'll release it as a really cohesive talk I'm kind of
1:13:15
Meandering here and sorting out my thoughts with you guys as a sounding board here okay but what I'm trying to get through to you here
1:13:21
is you have to have a thought process of seeing traps upon traps upon traps upon
1:13:27
traps lies upon lies upon lies upon lies and your job in my view is to see
1:13:35
through the Web of Lies and to see through your own Web of Lies then to do what you can to cleanse
1:13:43
yourself and then to become a source of light to help other people and this is also going to
1:13:50
accelerate dramatically with AI which could potentially become sentient we don't know the result of that yet that's
1:13:56
remains to be seen um and the advancement of society right so it's
1:14:01
going to it's going to really really separate the wheat from the chaff my view is that step one is put the oxygen
1:14:09
mask on yourself so learn how to make the cash that you want learn how to get
1:14:14
the social life you want learn how to build the lifestyle that you want because that in of itself is such a great exercise because it shows you how
1:14:21
to take a lot of action then as you're taking action now you can start seeing outside of that
1:14:29
and you know you can begin to say to yourself okay there's more to life than this but from a weaken position you
1:14:35
can't really be that influential you know I've worked with Charities they can they can't pay their bills they're broke
1:14:42
they're ineffective because they kind of tried to help everybody else before helping themselves so that's where I
1:14:47
want you thinking about how to help yourself so for me how did I come across
1:14:53
this process I spent a couple decades mastering social skills and learning how to crush it at that I learned how to
1:14:59
build a business around it um I learned I mean I clearly learned
1:15:04
enough about mastering my body and vitality I haven't been sick in 12 years I don't teach that because I don't give medical advice but I learned it an
1:15:10
otally for me worked on a many many different skill sets but then you sit
1:15:16
there and I'm sitting there coming up on 44 and I'm going this is all
1:15:23
dumb this is dumb like you ever see those videos of
1:15:30
somebody say in India in a giant trash sheep sorting it
1:15:35
out what does it matter if if you're the king of the trash
1:15:43
sheep so a powerful shift in my view is starting a different quality
1:15:50
conversation and that [ __ ] that that quality conversation becomes like
1:15:55
if something you does everybody in here believe in being at the cause of your life and not the
1:16:01
effect do you believe not only that you can completely and utterly turn your life around but more so that you have
1:16:09
the capacity to emate that light out outside yourself yes okay
1:16:16
so do you also believe that Humanity has a huge amount of untapped potential do
1:16:22
you believe that abely okay so so but the thing is that's all very abstract when it's like yeah but I can't I'm too
1:16:28
afraid to approach a girl right or you know I can't make you know I don't even make 50k so it's all very abstract right
1:16:36
so it's actually very narcissistic to talk about things like Global change but not to talk about how to make 50k people
1:16:42
often come to me they're like are you going to be a billionaire I'm like that's self-destructive that's not that you lack a limiting belief that's
1:16:49
self-destructive talk about the next thing get specific the actual result
1:16:56
then you can stack results so first you do the impossible in your own life you
1:17:01
break the odds you do the impossible then you start to show others how to do The Impossible and then what you do is
1:17:09
you start digging into the system itself now by the way and again that 50% that I
1:17:14
can talk about the 50% that I can't I've had some big big big wins that if I told you guys your jaws would drop major
1:17:20
major wins yeah tears would come to your eyes major wins that's not something I
1:17:25
post on social media but we've had major wins Global level but that but I'm just
1:17:31
getting started okay and this is something like you know Ragnar lothbrook
1:17:37
you ever see the show Vikings Ragnar needed his children to finish his legacy right that will be my
1:17:44
work will be like uh you know a Joe Kennedy or something like that where it was his kids and his ancestors that had
1:17:52
to carry the torch I can't get this done in my lifetime I'm not going going to be able to okay I can't live long I can do
1:17:57
all this stuff but I can't I'm not going to make it you know till the end I wish I could man I wish I could you know I
1:18:03
wish I had more time right I wish I had more time but I don't so you know and I don't know how much time I do have so
1:18:10
when you start thinking like that okay when you start thinking in that those kind of
1:18:15
conversations well then what starts happening is now you're getting into the real depth and and juice of life I think
1:18:24
because you realize that just being on a giant yacht calling it yours when when
1:18:29
in reality you're going to die and just someone else going to get it that doesn't have real meaning right but it's
1:18:34
it's as you drop in your real power and as you drop in to the real capabilities
1:18:40
that you do have and when you drop into that ability to be at the cause at the highest levels the rewards of that are
1:18:48
so pass your context that I don't have a way to relay it I can only ask you to think about areas that you've had wins
1:18:53
and just magnify that by a THX but you start you you start to because it's not anymore what you're
1:18:59
doing it's just who you're being as a person and the way that that opens up different psychological capacities and
1:19:05
different awarenesses there's just there's a um there's like a should to say qua of internal change that opens up
1:19:13
so let's break this down a bit a bit more simple okay broke and
1:19:20
frustrated yeah that sucks we get that right broke and frustrated sucks maybe you start to get sex
1:19:28
money some Freedom get to go places stuff like
1:19:34
that that would be an improvement but I think it's too
1:19:40
limiting I think billionaire is limiting I
1:19:46
think sex life limiting I think these are just the pleasures
1:19:51
of derp it's the pleasure of a derper is what it really
1:19:57
is um it's um rodent
1:20:04
food you know so you see some big fat rodent billionaire guy he's just a fat
1:20:12
rodent that's how I see it it's a fattened up rodent it's like a wellfed
1:20:19
cockroach again traps Beyond traps Beyond traps Beyond traps Beyond traps
1:20:25
lies Beyond lies Beyond lies Beyond lies Beyond lies okay the Bible as an
1:20:32
example is is like a beam of Lights it's like like that and just vaporizes the
1:20:40
lies but again you you have to understand it at a deeper level it's like this thing is like it's like this
1:20:46
weird laser beam that just vaporized and lies but you can't
1:20:52
understand you can't just look at a surface level it's it can't it doesn't I don't think
1:20:58
it's fully open to me by any means and it can't that can't open up to you it's
1:21:03
you're not able to have that open up to you until you've really done the work
1:21:08
and and then it begins to open up okay like a lot of the ideas that you learn here did any of you here maybe look at
1:21:13
my old school stuff and it took a couple years to really open up but when it opened up you're like whoa like this is
1:21:19
so crazy like you know how many of you here had even with my older stuff had just
1:21:25
absolutely mind shattering life changes that you never would have imagined when you first clicked on put your hand way
1:21:30
up if you had that mind shattering way up hands way up so people can see this at home mind shattering shocking crazy
1:21:38
changes right like you're yeah thank you guys thank you me too as I learned all
1:21:45
this but that doesn't stop that doesn't stop
1:21:51
okay so part of why I do free events is I do it
1:21:59
as practice the same way I go out and work on skill set as practice right I do it as practice um to try to you know
1:22:05
work on content sometimes I work on content that's like I'll do a bit that's really polished at a free event and then
1:22:11
sometimes I do more raw content at free events that are more rambling a bit all over the place a bit harder to follow
1:22:16
this i' put in the latter category it's a bit harder to follow it's like okay like what the [ __ ] are you talking about man okay but I would ask you guys to to
1:22:24
come up and tell me a bit about how you're interpreting what you're learning so far and then we'll go into some
1:22:31
exercises okay but I'd like to get some shares and people to come up but I'd
1:22:39
say can you imagine
1:22:46
like imagine you can just walk into any room right and you have total absolute
1:22:52
mental control over your state with very little fluctuation if you need to Surge your brain with dopamine you snap your
1:22:59
fingers you can do it you need to talk about you you have you need unlimited things to be able to talk about snap
1:23:04
your fingers you can do it frame control snap your fingers you can do it know how to make money snap your fingers you can
1:23:10
do it know how to have influence snap your fingers you can do it know how to create an energetic field in your body
1:23:15
no ailments snap your fingers you can do I'm not giving medical advice just a thought experiment okay now how to sub
1:23:22
in unlimited energy snap your fingers you can do it okay imagine what that's like now you have all the money you need
1:23:29
dating life fun friends travel that's your
1:23:34
foundation then you realize well wait a minute when I go do these fun thing I I
1:23:40
don't know what to do like now now I'm at 0 Z I'm at 0 Z now I'm an
1:23:47
adult what I described is not an ideal or Enlightenment what I described is
1:23:53
adulthood basic adulthood so now you're there okay amazing
1:23:59
great so now you say to yourself well I can do whatever I want what should I
1:24:05
do that's about a five-year journey I think screw waiting till you're 65 to
1:24:13
retire I think everyone here should retire for 5 years at 40 for about half
1:24:18
a decade at 40 if you're 40 now seeing this do a half decade at 50 do it while
1:24:23
you're younger when I was on that bus into denie everybody was in their 60s I got if I died in a car accident
1:24:30
today I had the most incredible 5 years so I got that I got that out of the way
1:24:36
okay I even got to do it for my children by bringing them so now it kind of feels like gravy why not do something for
1:24:42
yourself why not truly do something for yourself for a bit it's not that hard to get into a position like that just take
1:24:49
some Focus so now you do that then you start realizing
1:24:54
wow I'm not really that much happier than when I worked because emotional states are addictive so that 5 years you
1:25:00
can use that to to relook at how you're processing fun you know so maybe you do that first ski trip and you're kind of
1:25:07
like ah I kind of just feel like how I feel when I work but I'm on a hill but then you learn how to really have the
1:25:13
texture of of the beautiful mountain you learn to really focus on the trees you learn to focus on joking with your
1:25:19
friends you you recognize when you're making yourself happy or sad you you recognize how to really enoy en jooy
1:25:25
just the Turning of the skiing you have a new appreciation for the lodge a new
1:25:30
appreciation for being with your friends in the hottub an appreciation for sharing with people an appreciation for
1:25:35
being there alone you work on your pallet of letting it in and receiving
1:25:41
consciously you learn how to genuinely receive and you you got to go try different things I had to try five years
1:25:46
of things to even know what I want to do I didn't know what I want to do I was so bought into when you love what you do
1:25:54
you never work a day in your life I was bought into that I believed it and it was true in its own way for
1:26:01
sure I've got a fun job I like building skills of course but it's not it's not
1:26:07
it's too limiting it wasn't me learning how to really receive it was me learning more how to give and give and build and
1:26:13
build and master and master but there was no receiving part you got to even know what you're fighting for right I
1:26:19
got to the point I didn't really even know what I was fighting for anymore oh we've got to build this build that why
1:26:24
remember what I said on the first day when I said you don't want to just talk about the relationship you want to live the relationship you want to actually
1:26:30
live the relationship a bit right oh talk about becoming this better person self-development growth thank you why
1:26:37
not see what you do with that if you guys are learning from me and I don't know how to have fun why
1:26:43
would you even want to learn what am I leading you to what's the what's the what kind of uh Cedar replanting so
1:26:50
that's another component but see once you get past that that in my
1:26:55
view then what starts to happen is you start to really really look at who you are at the most core
1:27:00
level and imagine from there that what you begin to do is you begin to get more
1:27:08
and more tapped in so in other words you're training yourself this look kind of weird but you're training yourself to
1:27:16
open the receptivity to receive more so that five
1:27:22
years that you spend learning how to fun you're you know how Native Americans
1:27:27
often talk about being connected to the land I have a lot I could say about that by the
1:27:33
wayoo but woo what an interesting topic that is so many elements to that but like for
1:27:40
like in like the best way ever and in the most absurd but the mostly the best
1:27:47
but some oh my goodness anyway
1:27:52
so learning to allow and this will be weird what I'm going to say very abstract but to build a connection to
1:28:00
God's creation and to allow that to infuse
1:28:05
you and of man's creation so a simple skill set as an example would be can you
1:28:12
look at a leaf and cry can you look at a leaf and cry now
1:28:18
that sounds like the dumbest conversation of this whole weekend but is that any
1:28:24
worse than can you stare in your phone and zone out for 3 hours what is a leaf tell a leaf is the
1:28:34
greatest Miracle it's life it's life but you
1:28:40
can't even see it as what it is and that has a gift to give a leaf
1:28:46
has a gift to give you right so now what's happening is you're connecting to
1:28:51
the land and and then you might start to look even more deeply maybe you look at
1:28:57
things like sacred texts and what you start looking for is tears in the veil
1:29:03
what do I mean by a tear in the veil we have this sort of world that we
1:29:08
live in here and there's these little almost like a a Pin Needle that
1:29:13
occasionally pokes this sort of like a I don't know it be like if you're uh I've
1:29:20
actually never done this and don't plan to but you know say you were tag teaming somebody
1:29:25
and doing like a DP and you know there's like a uh a membrane in
1:29:32
between okay and it's like that one little membrane that's preventing
1:29:39
you from touching parts of your homeboy that you never want to touch right I'm just messing with you guys right now
1:29:45
okay so one of my big hobbies to mix up the most absurd things in these speeches so anyway um but no there's like it's
1:29:51
like a membrane okay and from that membrane it's like this Veil and every so often
1:29:58
just this little poke right and and learning where those
1:30:07
are and allowing yourself to be receptive to those and allowing that to
1:30:15
infuse your mind and you'll see shifts in pupils
1:30:20
you'll see shifts in thought patterns and you'll also o see tremendous resistance um you'll your your body and
1:30:28
soul will fight you and fight you and fight you um other people who are around
1:30:33
you that aren't ready to receive that will run and act very weird and uh could just be that you're
1:30:40
weird by the way so uh be aware of that too you're like I'm poking the membrane
1:30:45
but maybe you're weird my case you'll have to decide that for yourself so it's poking through right
1:30:53
and you're learning to absorb but to even be in a position to
1:30:59
do that is kind of tough right because you got to pay rent cuz you're lonely
1:31:05
you don't have the basics handled now you can work on things like that in parallel I think there's benefit to that
1:31:10
but it's kind of a little abstract it's a little hard to work on but can you look at a waterfall and
1:31:17
let that in can you look at a Sunset and let that in can you you understand what you're
1:31:24
actually looking at okay A a
1:31:31
watch is an illusion you can let this in because
1:31:37
it's not that bright but you can't let in a leaf the
1:31:43
the leaf is worth more than the watch okay but you can't let that in so then
1:31:51
what starts to happen is as you learn to receive and that opens up more um you'll see shifts in the
1:31:59
eyes uh in the pupils in the in the way that you look
1:32:04
in the way that you carry energy you will see shifts in the results that you can produce and what
1:32:10
you'll find is you go deeper and deeper into being at the
1:32:16
cause and then what happens is as you mirror the energy of your creator
1:32:23
you are fed more so now what's happening is you're shifting and shifting
1:32:30
internally to where you're able to receive
1:32:35
more right and you're ve you're seeing people very very differently you're
1:32:40
seeing yourself very very very very very very very differently but wanting to be
1:32:46
at the cause is something more appealing than having just the yacht it's who you're being
1:32:54
it's the energy that you're infused with it's the mental landscape and spiritual landscape that you
1:33:00
occupy and this is where you transcend the traps and traps and traps and traps
1:33:08
and traps now here's another trap another trap is in some ways of seeing
1:33:14
it lifespan the Trap of lifespan why is that because the hundred years that you
1:33:23
might live are still too short you can't win with money you can't
1:33:32
win with time because in a context of the infinite how
1:33:39
long is it 200 years it's still too short you can't win
1:33:44
you can't escape death via time so you can't you can stretch you
1:33:51
can go like that right okay Kobe Bryant died at what age
1:33:59
41 but did he die at 41 Kobe Bryant is thousands of years old
1:34:08
relative to a regular human 50,000 years old it doesn't matter that Kobe died at
1:34:14
41 it's also not a coincidence that Kobe died at
1:34:20
41 that's not a coincidence okay Kobe Kobe isn't
1:34:32
dead right what you mean by that Kobe never did die he's gone past that he's not in that
1:34:39
Paradigm that's not a paradigm that Kobe resides
1:34:45
in Kobe is in this room right
1:34:52
now it's called Sid I'm kid right now s is Kobe's biggest fan Kobe's in the room
1:35:01
now was Kobe a physical body by the time that he
1:35:07
finished when Kobe went for 60 in his last game with that injured body that wasn't his body that did that
1:35:14
right yeah his heart right that's an energy Kobe was no longer in the body he
1:35:19
had manifest something past that he's gone past that right remember Kobe's uh Kobe shoe commercial success about
1:35:27
success about success remember that yeah Kanye and Tony Robbins right but that's actually deeper than you think okay so
1:35:33
Kobe didn't die Kobe had become more what he what he
1:35:39
had what he had learned to you know create an ingredients of was past the
1:35:45
physical body it was it it was no longer important you know I I wish for Kobe's
1:35:51
family not to be traumatized I don't wish for for his daughter or the people in the helicopter to die nor do I wish
1:35:56
for the millions of people to die every year to die of anybody to die of anything to
1:36:04
die but that he was no longer his body by the time of his death so it it it no
1:36:10
longer okay he's a a Mystic by that point he's no longer Kobe so it doesn't
1:36:16
matter like if he lives longer that's really really really great I wish Kobe never bodies never died but but it's not
1:36:24
you're not seeing you're seeing it in the wrong Paradigm you're seeing this through a very very limited Paradigm I
1:36:30
wish that helicopter didn't crash I wish that they that that they would would have done a better job with the safety I think what happen to the kids and the
1:36:36
people that is sickening I'm very sad at what happened but I'm also able to see it at two levels not just one level not
1:36:43
at quite that level but yes in a basketball player so you it's it's that
1:36:49
like at a certain point are you even you know when you when you've gone to that that space are
1:36:55
you really your body anymore is that really the the the landscape that you inhabit anymore
1:37:02
really right like if you have a kid and you you know pump a kid out and you die well half your genes are left they're
1:37:08
still kind of runting around right you have the recessive genes that are still left so you're kind of still running around in a way but there's also things
1:37:15
that are being created inside of yourself um that are not just these kind of consumer culture derping floating
1:37:22
turds there's something else that's being built that is that is manifesting
1:37:27
that is that is its own thing that is its own first mover and that you feel
1:37:33
inhabiting inside of yourself and that spreads and that that just like having
1:37:39
sex and having kids is one way to expand your Core Essence but that's in your genes um another way is that Core
1:37:47
Essence and how that spreads into the world so there's there's different forms
1:37:53
of life that we don't there's discussions that we're not having there there's conversations that we're missing
1:37:59
and there's potentials that we're not uncovering we're just seeing it in this really really limited
1:38:06
box and we're H we're being frame controlled so you know I I know frame control cuz I learn it in dating right I
1:38:13
go into a club I'm this like balding ginger dwarf man dwarf creature and I
1:38:19
will set a frame that's how I succeed I'm setting a frame but society and our
1:38:25
life and the way that we think about life and our lifestyle that frame has been set what we prioritize those frames
1:38:31
have been said we don't think past that frame we want the Gucci graphic te we
1:38:36
want the mega yacht we we're not Thinking Beyond we're not thinking we're not
1:38:42
asking what is this place what is this what is this this crap this stuff this
1:38:50
beauty this art this nature this chemical pot what is it we just sipped
1:38:59
around in it like a bug
1:39:05
so you're witnessing like the midlife crisis of a guy that became a millionaire too young okay I became a
1:39:10
millionaire at 26 okay so you're witnessing the midlife Christ
1:39:17
of God that got laid a little too much you know right like you've been getting laid for like decades you're just like what am I doing why what is what am I
1:39:25
going to fight in this hole I came out of this hole I've been try to get back in for 20 years there's something here
1:39:31
where is it what am I doing
1:39:38
okay is there something
1:39:45
here where am I you know it's like P guys I ate an
1:39:53
every fancy restaurant you've ever seen I'm pot belly from it every piece of good food ate it lived in the craziest
1:40:00
places did the crazy parties hung out with celebrities traveled everywhere I want to go did everything I want to do I
1:40:06
did it all I did it all
1:40:14
okay it's just this big flurry of [ __ ] you just run around you just do
1:40:21
all this [ __ ] can you just that you're just
1:40:31
like you know and then people come see you and they're like how do I do this
1:40:37
[ __ ] well I know the answer and then these [ __ ] take what I'm saying here
1:40:43
and use it as an excuse to not take any action at all believing that they have bypassed that process by being a
1:40:50
floating turd so you can't even talk about it without
1:40:56
them taking it a way that's self-destructive oh well then I don't have to do
1:41:02
anything so let's go deeper so we're going we're looking at a
1:41:10
problem okay and then we're going right we're pulling back we're in
1:41:15
Google Maps right oh here's the street there's the city there's the country
1:41:21
there's the planet there's Galaxy you know we're looking at it right and we're
1:41:27
looking at this and saying okay well what do I want who am I what is this place what do I want what am I doing
1:41:34
okay and it's kind of like going to school grade one grade two grade three grade
1:41:41
four and the grades just kind of keep going so we practice this art form on
1:41:47
basic day-to-day stuff okay the first step is admitting that if you're not smashing it you got to realize just what
1:41:55
utter pathetic and incompetent and sad of a situation that is and and you've
1:42:02
got to really go within yourself and say to yourself how did I cause this why am I at the cause of this what decisions
1:42:09
would I made different what did I not understand what information I did not get exposed to and then you start
1:42:17
looking at that then you start fixing yourself in other words you sweep your
1:42:22
own porch sweep your own porch get into a life position of what it is that you want
1:42:30
boom that provides the bandwidth an ability to look a little bit deeper okay
1:42:37
and so like I said um what happens is as you are able to Source energy in deeper
1:42:45
and deeper places now the shift that's also happening is right now you're in a derp
1:42:53
State and negative and then what you do is you get little glimpses of light from like an
1:43:01
ice cream or maybe you got laid okay so you got a little a little glimpse of light but your system isn't built to
1:43:09
absorb all the light that you could get it's not your system's not wired for it all these fantasies about winning the lottery it's too much light on the
1:43:16
system so why there's no point in giving money to your children why would I give money to my children
1:43:21
why why would you you do that if if I give you $100 million right now that's
1:43:28
like taking a magnifying glass out a worm and just frying it you can't absorb
1:43:34
that you don't have the internal receptors to even absorb all that it's like as if you say oh you want the light
1:43:39
on then I take that big light and I put it right in your face it just burns your eyes out you're not able to absorb that right so it's an actual process to learn
1:43:45
how to absorb more light and part of the traps remember we talked about traps traps on traps on
1:43:51
traps on traps part of the Trap is that winning within the Paradigm
1:43:57
of just money is actually train in train it's an entrainment it's like a narcissistic abuse type entrainment
1:44:04
that's entraining you to live only with sunglasses on so in other words um money
1:44:12
is refracted light sex is refracted light it's still not the Pure Source
1:44:19
you're still just getting refracted light don't be abstract about it just think about that in Practical terms you
1:44:25
don't need to be abstract right derp State oh money der State orgasm derb
1:44:32
state food right is that what's that really doing derb State more food keep
1:44:37
you in it right yeah you're still kind of in it quick question yeah you got to be louder though do do you feel like
1:44:43
when you experience that pure light it becomes harder to pursue the refractions
1:44:49
of it well I think the first thing is like let's not pretend that I or you experience light we're ders but but what
1:44:55
I'm saying is the derper beginning to awaken but is it a spectrum yeah so like
1:45:02
as close as you can get to it maybe not the whole thing like you're saying of course but like the closer you get to
1:45:08
that it becomes harder to chase yeah but remember
1:45:14
that as we move up the money's handled yeah the money keeps getting more the
1:45:19
money keeps stacking up the paper keeps stacking up dating all that keeps stacking up you don't lose that you just
1:45:26
retain it and do it's like if you're in the first grade you you do 1+ 1 equal 2 you don't lose that so you go to your
1:45:33
first and second and third grade you these are these are tools that enable us to move up this is why communist
1:45:39
countries in my view are built to seal your soul they don't allow you to move up through the chain and to take
1:45:44
responsibility and see all the consequences of it so they're built to keep your soul on Earth they're they're built as Soul uh Soul jails is a
1:45:53
communism it it's built to the stopping of Freedom doesn't allow you to fail it doesn't allow you have to bear the full
1:45:58
consequences so it's designed to keep everybody enslaved their Spirit on Earth to to die out so it's uh Satan so but
1:46:07
again that's abstract so the thing so basically what you have is
1:46:13
um uh if it's a quick question yeah yeah um you got to be louder you got to talk
1:46:19
faster okay so does doing abstinence abstaining from all this other stuff no
1:46:24
no abstinence just win at it just go win at it it doesn't take more than 18 months all this talk of like material
1:46:31
stuff doesn't matter you're 18 months away from having it why are we even talking about upstanding from it it takes two seconds guys stop you all know
1:46:38
that you could crush it if you just focus for two three years probably a year and a half but two three years most you all know you could boom you'd have
1:46:43
it stop stop stop stop stop stop it's just dumb it's just dumb it's just dumb
1:46:51
come on stop it okay just stop it okay you can solve this so just focus your damn mind for a
1:46:58
hot minute so that you don't need to run around like some broke fool some you
1:47:03
know some sexless broke incel fool uh you know to be able to receive light that's just dumb that's a
1:47:11
scam so okay we'll keep going down the thing here so why okay so I've coach
1:47:18
billionaires coach multimillionaires they're still in refracted light they still had that same soulless gaze the
1:47:25
majority of them they're just in the other end of the Trap itself right so let's look at
1:47:32
the kind of transformation that we're talking about okay so the the frames that you've had put in front of you are
1:47:38
limited limited limited limited limited limited limited limited limited like I
1:47:44
look you in the face I see disconnection from Source that's all I'm looking at
1:47:50
disconnection from source probably you work a job that's tough this might be a bit late for you you're sitting in a
1:47:57
chair and you're disconnected from source and you're just trying you're like hey I'm trying man trying my man
1:48:04
trying here buddy yeah pick it on me for man I'm just trying here bro I'm in your
1:48:09
audience I'm your fan bro right that's how I see it that's that's what I'm looking at okay but I also see the
1:48:14
potential that you have the potential of you to evolve the potential of you to change right so let's bring up a couple
1:48:20
people so I'm going to have you guys come up and tell me a little bit about what you're deriving from uh what it is
1:48:26
that we're talking about here today okay we we'll bring it up so uh so what I'm gathering from this uh my takeaway is to
1:48:34
audit and kind of figure out what you want actually from Life um rather than
1:48:43
like following the program that has kind of been given to us so for
1:48:49
example uh maybe you don't need to be a millionaire or a a billionaire maybe
1:48:55
that's too much um uh and the operative word being maybe
1:49:02
maybe cuz maybe it's the right path but maybe it's not it's by the individual right like if if your passion life is to
1:49:09
gather money and that makes you happy then you know get those stats no no but even question that even question if that
1:49:16
even makes you happy no no it actually might don't let yourself off the hook
1:49:22
there's some people people for whom Gathering Finance has deep meaning that is real not every rich person is
1:49:28
miserable there's a lot of people who really enjoy making Global change so there's you know or just love the game
1:49:34
of it for their own reasons for their own biology there's different reasons but you have to be honest about those reasons okay like learning more how to
1:49:42
handle like the light you know we we get the the the fractal stuff like money and
1:49:49
sex and stuff like that but kind of um you know getting those and moving up the
1:49:55
Paradigm so that you can handle more of the light
1:50:00
that that I guess is God in the universe um so yeah give a hand guys thank you
1:50:09
thank [Music]
1:50:14
you so what I'm gathering from this is we're basically in a war for our own humanity and personhood we're all in a
1:50:21
basically sleeping hay we think we're alive we're really not we're all just kind of coasting
1:50:28
through life and it's basically a test that you can decide not to try to answer
1:50:34
any of the questions but you have basically the rest of Eternity to be dead and be forgotten so you have a kind
1:50:41
of a small window and we're basically being our basically our energy and our
1:50:47
spirituality and our life force is being siphoned off from us and we have to first of all we have to appreciate the
1:50:52
value of it by basically going out into the world because like you said the um the Rolex watch isn't really anything
1:51:00
compared to a leaf but yet we idolize one thing and we put a dollar amount of value on it and um the leaf is the very
1:51:09
thing that like lets us breathe literally lets us breathe air into our lungs and breathe life into us and we
1:51:15
just pass it by yeah because of it's an abundance but again every breath is like what keeps you alive so a lot of what we
1:51:23
Chase is basically pointless the sex the money the power the status everything is
1:51:31
essentially we're all something is basic making us chase all the wrong things so
1:51:37
get it as an exercise to achieving humanity and personhood but not as the
1:51:43
ends of itself it's basically a means to something greater that you can't really right in this room at this me none of us
1:51:49
can really verbalize at some point and just kind of trust a process that kind of will go beyond your own lifetime if
1:51:56
you commit to it and devote to it and that's exactly like why I'm here today to kind of just to commit to a bigger
1:52:02
process that'll go long after them six feet under I think that's great and I I'll just add to a little bit of that
1:52:08
too which is that um the work in and of itself is important as he said but it's the frame
1:52:17
of reference that you use towards it so for example I understand that a extensive watch
1:52:23
is worth more in the marketplace than a leaf due to the law of supply and demand
1:52:28
I understand that an expensive watch is a quick way to show other wealthy clients that you've achieved some
1:52:35
success it's just a quick frame of reference for them to look at it um it's also a store of value when you buy an
1:52:40
expensive watch uh you can resell them by the way it's literally just a place to lock up a bit of money um they don't really lose value unless the market
1:52:45
change dramatically so it's a place to lock up a bit of money and it's a place to um to you know show other people oh I
1:52:53
have I it's a it's a quick frame of reference to show other people that you're not like a complete joke if
1:52:59
they're first meeting you so it has value in and of that it has value in and of that it is more scarce than a leaf
1:53:06
because you can get leaves anywhere but spiritually where you tether your soul
1:53:12
and where you Source your energy has to be the leaf is lesson so there's the
1:53:21
practicalities of life you got to pay rent may you want to have some kids you
1:53:26
want to go some cool trips but is that where you intertwine your soul would be the the takeaway there and what's the
1:53:32
bigger Journey could you give a hand thank you that's [Music]
1:53:39
great I mean is it on this side there we go I just want to say like it's just
1:53:46
kind of crazy like it's it's really sad how many of us there are and how much of
1:53:51
the population really just doesn't even like care like we're all here and like
1:53:56
most of us here won't even really make it and just the fact you have a free tour and you spend all this money and
1:54:02
you're ow and cook and you do all this and that literally people people like
1:54:07
they'll just like you said they'll go get the Apple they'll go grocery shopping but they won't come here for 3 days are you kidding me this changes
1:54:15
your life this really does writing notes this thing right here this has really changed my life and it's just crazy that
1:54:20
they won't even come here they can't resonate with it cuz they're so out of it they're so out of it they just like they don't even think about
1:54:29
it it it's just it's just really mindblowing and you're right it really isn't that hard to be a millionaire you
1:54:37
just really got to focus and do it and just like wake up just wake up to the moment when he's yelling at that person
1:54:42
he's not mad at that person he might be a little angry about something he's not mad personally at the at the camera crew
1:54:48
but it's just so obvious that you could just just do it just you're so mindless you just got to wake up to it and it's
1:54:54
just it's just crazy yeah so I'll tell you the way I would I would interpret that would be and I'm just sort of
1:54:59
adding my tweaks onto it so from a Bas level standpoint you want to imagine your life
1:55:07
like a boa constrictor is tightening up on you okay and it's it's choking you to
1:55:14
where you're half conscious and then what a boa will do is it kind of loosens up because if you're fighting and
1:55:19
fighting it'll loosen up so that you'll kind of relax and stop fighting and then boom and tightens up okay so what's
1:55:27
happening how many of you here have ever had this feeling like if you could just
1:55:34
feel good you could just relax into that for
1:55:39
eternity and die you know that feeling like if you
1:55:45
could just if you could just lose yourself in an orgasm for example or an
1:55:50
ice cream if you could just ah because it's just so
1:55:57
hard life is so hard life is so
1:56:02
confusing life is so hard right and so if someone could just
1:56:09
come along with like a good feeling and just remove the noise of the mind and
1:56:17
the weight of existence just remove that weight of existence from you right
1:56:23
and allow you to relax into it and you could just
1:56:30
vanish so that feeling is how they get you okay that feeling is how they get
1:56:36
you because as you become entrained on
1:56:41
Pleasure ego path least resistance derping
1:56:47
floating turism uh not um uh you get addicted on
1:56:52
2 plus 2 equals 5 as we saw in 2020 and you just get it's it's a it's a
1:56:58
it's a demoralization process say that with me demoralization process say that
1:57:03
again demoralization process say it's a will sapping process say
1:57:08
that so what's happening there is we we
1:57:13
slowly methodically get demoralized and as we're demoralized the
1:57:19
boa it goes like that and you're fighting and you're fighting and you're fighting and it's just tiring you're
1:57:27
just tired I don't want to fight this anymore I don't have the will to fight this anymore and I'm going to die anyway
1:57:34
and because I'm going to die anyway if I could just relax for even a minute then for even one minute of my life my
1:57:41
pathetic little life I could relax before this thing snaps my neck right there was a movie called The Gray with Liam niss where there's wolves their
1:57:50
plane crashes I believe it was Alaska and there's wolves chasing them but they
1:57:56
can't escape the Wolves right they're in the middle of Alaska they're not going to make it home and there's wolves chasing them now this
1:58:01
movie is created in such a manner that there is no escape and I'll get you keep saying but
1:58:08
I'm walk the crowd B I'll come back to you there's no Escape From The Wolves they can't escape it okay now if in the
1:58:16
movie they can beat the wolves and survive that movie just became a four to
1:58:22
six out of 10 movie because it's kind of like some CGI wolves it's not even a
1:58:27
real representation of wolves by the way wolves aren't going to do that that's my understanding and they're not as like vicious and stalking people as that is
1:58:33
my understanding and maybe I'm wrong but that's how I understand it and so the only thing that makes that movie a true
1:58:40
10 is that he can't survive it so the movie is not a Cheesy action movie
1:58:46
fighting wolves like Jaws but for wolves the movie is a metaphor for the reality
1:58:51
that we all live in which is that there is no difference between and let me be
1:58:57
clear here let me be objectively clear there is no difference to your life
1:59:03
right now if you live to be a 100 and live in a city and Liam niss in the fictional
1:59:10
movie which is from a book is my understanding um running from some wolves and has 5 days to live there is
1:59:17
no actual difference none you are in that reality right now there's no
1:59:23
difference can anybody guess why I would say that use your use your creativity
1:59:29
who wants to take a real stab at why I say that who wants to take a stab at it okay so it's a riddle okay come on up
1:59:36
you want to take a stab at it if you want to take a real stab out it yeah okay so why is there no difference in
1:59:45
fact why is it arguable that Liam Nissan's life is better than yours is
1:59:52
crash in Alaska 5 days is to live whatever it would be being chase BS why is that a better life than what you have
2:00:00
now I mean I I wasn't trying to make a whole speech about it I thought it was going to be a quick answer but what I
2:00:06
thought go for it man let's go let's use your creativity the initial thoughts I had
2:00:12
was because you're going to die anyways and then you're going to suffer anyways
2:00:17
and the reason his is better is because it's quicker and you know when it's coming pretty much rather other than
2:00:23
this just in my there well let's remove suffering as a negative what if suffering is not a negative so now let's
2:00:29
so now let's keep going what if suffering is not a negative why does Liam have an advantage over us the the
2:00:36
Liam's character l i mean is suffering a
2:00:42
negative is suffering a negative okay let's keep going maybe maybe less options you know he
2:00:49
could you know rather than we have so many options to choose from it's like you could get like sort of analysis
2:00:54
paralysis maybe whether in in his situation is just like get away from Wolf get food get shelter that's it like
2:01:01
very basic compared to all the Motions that we might have to get through with like do I do this do I do that
2:01:07
prioritizing sort of either relationship work life whatever whether it's like when it's just pure survival it's just
2:01:14
like one one instinctual thing yes okay can you give me a hand for that thank you for taking a crack thank you
2:01:27
eternity 100,000 years how long is 100,000 years in the context of
2:01:33
Galaxy nothing how long is 100 years in the context of Galaxy nothing how long's 5
2:01:40
days it's also nothing but at least with 5 days you know it's nothing so knowing
2:01:46
that it's only 5 days you have the opportunity to resolve whatever it is that you're here to resolve cuz you know
2:01:51
what you're dealing with you don't know where you are right now you don't know what you're dealing with right now you don't fully know you're going to die right now it's not even fully real to
2:01:56
you so you're not even forced to make those changes at least knowing that you would be dead in 5 days you would be
2:02:02
rapidly and aggressively forced to make the changes that you're here to make he's at an advantage suffering is not a
2:02:08
disadvantage you're still inside the Box pleasure good suffering bad you're still inside that box yes some suffering is
2:02:14
horrific I understand that we want to we want to minimalize suffering and not just like take that idea too far okay I
2:02:20
understand that you know someone dying leukemia we should try to alleviate suffering but I'm making the point that there is some also value in suffering
2:02:27
that we're forgetting about and suffering is also what prompts us to make those Evolutions if you had only 5 days left to make those Evolutions you'd
2:02:33
be better off than living within the hamster cage system that distracts you you never make the change your Life's
2:02:39
Too Short anyway you can't escape death in this you can only Escape it in this
2:02:45
you can't escape death in this you can only escape death in this Kobe is you
2:02:51
should never feel bad about Kobe you should feel bad
2:02:56
about you Kobe didn't die you might Kobe's still here you might not be so he
2:03:04
Kobe got over the fence you are remain to be seen so it why would you worry
2:03:10
about Kobe it doesn't mean that I don't get mad at the helicopter service or that people suffered or died but there's
2:03:16
there's I'm seeing it from two layers from a base layer I'm mad I want Kobe back I hate what happened I hate it for
2:03:21
his family it's a tragedy but from another layer there's another way of seeing it so I'm trying to encourage you
2:03:26
guys to see that in a little bit of a in a little bit of a different way so what they're doing is they've got you in this
2:03:33
constricted Zone okay and let's get very very practical here they've got you boom in here and you're going unconscious all
2:03:40
of you in this room struggle with unconsciousness you're all struggling with it the whole day the whole day you struggle with unconsciousness all of you
2:03:46
you can't do approaching you can't you can't get the money you want you can't just because you're unconscious right and then they just keep putting trinkets
2:03:51
in in front of you it's like the boin search is letting it go you want to think about it okay look how many of you
2:03:56
here have ever been out a bar club and you start doing approaches and you feel your state amplifying like a flywheel
2:04:03
and you feel your will amplifying in a flywheel you ever felt that okay that's
2:04:08
actual life that's life in a nutshell there so you want to think about it like reconnecting to your will and you want
2:04:15
that moving like a flywheel and that will what it's doing your will in and of
2:04:21
itself you want to add anything more by the way what you taking from this I'm taking it all in right now okay go have
2:04:26
a seat then okay okay I thought you might have a little more but I like it keep thinking okay so your your
2:04:31
will it's a flywheel okay now what you're doing as you progress is you're
2:04:38
looking at your will and you're getting more and more connected to it more and more connected to it more and more
2:04:43
connected to it that will is like the pure light that vaporizes all the
2:04:48
parasites vaporizes the distraction vaporizes the different directions that you're being pulled in then what starts
2:04:55
happening is because it's a flywheel you know the rich get richer the poor get poor people
2:05:01
who are losing their will tend to lose it more and more people who are gaining in will tend to gain more and more it's a flywheel so now your whe is going up
2:05:07
and up and up then what it's doing is it's densifying so it's getting tighter tighter tighter tighter tighter tighter
2:05:13
right it's like Platinum versus a looser metal you know it's getting it's just
2:05:18
getting strong okay now it's getting to the point where your will you're if you're able to
2:05:24
truly control your mind and your Core Essence your will is going to begin to tighten up to where in the same way that
2:05:29
a syringe can poke through skin because it's just so small there's no resistance you can get it you can learn to focus
2:05:36
the mind at such a small Point that's it's like like that and just and your
2:05:41
will right through and the metal by which it is made is so dense so imagine
2:05:47
you had the thinnest thinnest thinnest possible syringe looking thing and it
2:05:53
was made with the strongest metal and you could literally just go into anything and just
2:06:01
go okay so your will is not encountering
2:06:07
resistance and strong now how does that happen well you
2:06:14
have to peel back the layers right so now what happens is you is you're sitting there with your will and you're
2:06:20
like eh okay I can make some money okay cool
2:06:26
great cool okay I focus all day I I I did my little rendition of uh jono willink or
2:06:33
uh uh who's the other the runner who's amazing uh goggin okay I'm gogin now do
2:06:38
my goggin thing okay amazing super cool so they're great love those guys great examples so now you have that but what
2:06:46
starts to happen is you say this is not the right fuel this is just not the right fuel this not enough
2:06:51
this isn't enough I need more power okay more power why is that why do you want more
2:07:04
power because you just re you see the [ __ ]
2:07:10
this is [ __ ] [ __ ] like you're you're sitting there you're like
2:07:17
okay I got money now I'm in a house it's a big house okay
2:07:25
sex H okay gmet food H okay now you don't now look you want to enjoy this
2:07:31
stuff you don't want to be so your head so far up your own ass you can't enjoy a [ __ ] meal you know you got some
2:07:37
bombshell giving you a little bit of attention have some fun man of course
2:07:43
can't enjoy that you're an idiot but you're also like well what else Dan
2:07:48
bueren talks about this he's like I got $350 million I all like to do is just hang out with my friends and serve the
2:07:54
simulation starts working so what happens is you you realize that your will has been used for what your will is
2:08:02
what this biological Mass roaming the Earth like a worm how is that will any
2:08:10
differ than a cow how are you categorically different than a
2:08:15
cow you want to hump and and get some hay or something right sleep so so then so then maybe you use
2:08:23
that you know to do other things like for example fulfill your ego but the ego
2:08:28
is a parasitic false flywheel overlay on top of your
2:08:34
Consciousness so all that you're doing is feeding a fake overlay you're feeding a false self so you're basically feeding
2:08:41
a cow and some creepy parasite overlay on your
2:08:47
brain again my midlife crisis from living a really fun 20 years okay
2:08:54
so great so now so now you have that okay
2:08:59
cool so you fed a weird parasite on top of your [ __ ]
2:09:05
brain and you fed a cow and who's the cow you're the
2:09:13
cow okay so you you fed to some
2:09:19
stupid dying
2:09:24
ephemeral parasite that in the grand scheme of things is
2:09:30
irrelevant that you thought was you that was sucking energy off you the entire
2:09:36
time it was sucking you dry of energy and it was serving as a light refractory
2:09:45
system so you can't even take in light it's blocking the light that's why we meditate simple right why do you
2:09:51
meditate get out of thought light comes in so so that's your life your life is
2:09:59
feeding a cow and a
2:10:05
parasite great job so some people feed the cow and the
2:10:10
parasite better than others so but then the worst part is again I say this and then the main way
2:10:16
people take it is well then cool then I'll be lazy cool now you're a dying cow and
2:10:24
parasite you didn't escape the Trap that way
2:10:30
either you spend your whole life trying to fix it create the problem and you spend your whole life trying to fix the
2:10:37
problem yeah here come up and share then share the I like that come and share with the crowd you're you're seeing
2:10:48
it um I was just saying saying that we create I was just saying that we create
2:10:54
our own problems and then we spent our whole life trying to get rid of the
2:11:00
problem or like you said being egotistic like the billionaires they're leaning on
2:11:07
the yacht that's why when they get the yacht they're like damn this sucks let just kill myself yeah but also some of
2:11:13
them like it too so so we don't want to write it off right some people actually that is a good thing for him to do but
2:11:20
depends it depends is that where you're get sourcing energy from you can't lean on it you can't lean on nothing but you
2:11:27
you can't depend on the government you can't depend on Owen you can't depend on your mom you can't depend on anybody you
2:11:34
got to just trust yourself and depend on yourself I'd say that's a good Next Step
2:11:39
there's broader layers to that but that's a great next step and use put the mic here and that's why like put the mic and that's why like politics they play
2:11:47
with us like we look like puppets they just Donald Trump everybody just plays with us and a good book that woke me up
2:11:55
to that was outwitting the devil it shows you from Young how they make us
2:12:00
stand in line it's like it's crazy bro it's freaking crazy like like and that's
2:12:07
why I appreciate this guy cuz he could just manipulate all you guys he could see the weakness in you but he's showing
2:12:13
you like dog I'm I I could make you guys do what I want but that's not the point
2:12:19
and if I do that I'm killing myself at I'm I'm killing myself now I'm good I'm
2:12:25
good I'm good I'm good you know what I'm saying like cuz if you do that you're
2:12:31
not abundant it's like robbing somebody it's like bashing somebody it's like bro why you doing that if you're blessed
2:12:37
already you don't need to steal why steal if you're blessed why would you do that because stealing at it at a core
2:12:43
level is at consumer level not Creator level it's demonic rather than creation
2:12:49
so you're only the criminal only hurts themselves right they hurt themselves
2:12:55
thousands of times worse than the person being victimized and when you and when you not not thousands by the way
2:13:01
infinitely more and when you uh trust in yourself you can be a billionaire go
2:13:07
broke be a billionaire again cuz you know who you are you know your worth and you're not afraid like you're not a this
2:13:15
is luck that's why when people make money they self-sabotage but the the superstars the NBA players most of the
2:13:22
NBA players after the fifth fifth year of them retired to go back
2:13:27
broke you know understand is a m like bro and and by the way you want to think of it like multiple Dimensions there's
2:13:33
the dimension of pragmatic life money success social relationships then
2:13:39
there's the dimension beyond that again Kobe at the physical level horrific sad
2:13:47
tragedy but there's another level that exists to in parallel so in the same way making money
2:13:55
is important but there's other things that are important in parallel and you
2:14:01
got to know what you're doing it for like he said like which is the key Point why do you want $100 million why do you
2:14:06
want it ask yourself that you chasing the money you don't even know what you want it for you don't even know why you
2:14:12
want the money but you're chasing the money that's why he said I'll give you $100 and you wouldn't know what I'll
2:14:18
give you $100 million and you wouldn't know what to do with it when you get it it's too much light off or you crash out
2:14:23
you just start drinking beers and overeating you know doing all the [ __ ] killing yourself that's why a
2:14:30
lot of people who win the lottery like damn I don't know if you guys ever heard of the lottery curse some guys are like
2:14:36
damn I wish I never won the money it just [ __ ] up my life like I wish I
2:14:41
never imagine saying I wish I never hit the lottery imagine saying that you understand me so cuz cuz it disrupts
2:14:47
your Evolution and your whole process that you're meant to go through it just mess with you it's like you're playing this cool video game and they just bump you to the end of the game and you're
2:14:55
like like I've been watching these guys for Years bro and it's like to the point
2:15:00
where I stopped listening to music I'm like y why what the [ __ ] are they saying like what the [ __ ] is this guy
2:15:06
figure out too what is this guy really saying bro like and everybody's like yeah this guy's [ __ ] hard yo it's my
2:15:12
[ __ ] I'm like bro what are you saying bro this guy's trash like I I I love I
2:15:18
love I understand it cuz you know you know I listen to rap I understand the music but it's like I get where they're
2:15:24
coming from it's like bro this is gibberish like my girl she doesn't listen to my wife she doesn't listen to
2:15:31
rap so she's like babe what is this this guy's hurting my ear like this guy's really hurting my why why you know I'm
2:15:38
saying right conditioning you like and and that's another thing you looking up to idolizing people like you're not
2:15:45
supposed to allize nobody you're not supposed to look up to nobody God that's it that's it that's it bro you come here
2:15:52
to look up to him you're wasting your time I'm telling you that right now just get the gems that he's giving you and
2:15:58
move forward don't come in like oh my God Owen like he said and people run
2:16:04
away from that like bro why do you want my autograph just be normal bro like oh no that's Jay-Z right there I want to
2:16:10
why you want his signature for for what for what another thing that kills me too
2:16:16
is another thing that's killed me too right is like when people fan out when they see a superstar and they go crazy
2:16:22
to me I think it's insane oh my God Jas oh my [ __ ] God picture like Yo what
2:16:28
the is wrong with well what that is by the way it's from the book of Exodus um people worshiping a golden calf so it's
2:16:35
another light refractory is the golden calf is a light refractory worshiping Jay-Z is a light refractory it's just a
2:16:41
way yeah it's uh idolatry right and that's like a museum up in B
2:16:47
Library by uh right everybody's going crazy on Instagram like Oh The Rock I'm
2:16:53
like yo bro do you even know what sign you're putting up do you even know what you're doing do you really know what you're doing bro you're just following
2:16:59
the trend to look good to get likes which is not paying you it's not making you feel better but you know you you
2:17:06
feel good when you get the likes like damn I got like 20 likes damn yeah I'm doing it man I got a100 million do yeah
2:17:13
I'm that I got a rly bro y look at me made it but remember this too that's
2:17:18
also we have a parallel realities and it doesn't we don't get
2:17:24
out of the practicalities of one reality we have to explore both so in other words um a lot
2:17:32
of really powerful self-development work uh requires time you know when Sid came
2:17:37
with me for four years and got to basically Sid and me have been rolling together for four years right well he
2:17:43
did that because he studied mergers and Acquisitions was able to have all the money to be able to take four years off
2:17:50
work I was able to explore this taking four or five years off work so now that
2:17:55
doesn't mean you couldn't do that while you're working you absolutely can but just realize it's just one foot in one
2:18:02
reality one foot in a different reality you're multi-dimensional you got to make time to you got to meditate bro you got
2:18:08
to make time for yourself bro you can't let the system run you like a battery
2:18:14
bro you just can't let that happen you got to make time for yourself like he said it's the balance like even with the
2:18:20
Rolex like if if he says something he's raring a Rolex you're going to listen to it if I
2:18:25
have a Apple watch on ass so sometimes you use these things to get people attention you got to you got to use it
2:18:32
just like money money is a tool it's not something to money's a tool it's not something to just show off and brag like
2:18:39
if you my opinion if I can't make you a millionaire I'm I'm nothing bro if I
2:18:46
can't change your life then I'm not doing nothing like so I would say you're nothing but yeah you you know what I
2:18:51
mean like not nothing of course just something but what I'm saying is like if I think what you're saying is you want to learn to be at the cause and be able
2:18:57
to produce a result right right that's just what it is for me man and and I I'm
2:19:03
it's crazy that I've been standing here cuz I know all this information I've been watching these guys and my friends
2:19:08
think I'm freaking crazy like yo bro what is this guy I'm like you just don't get it it's over your head it's going over your head and you're not going to
2:19:15
get it it's like the more time I tell them this they start attacking yeah Junes you're going to go to that yeah
2:19:20
that guy with the orange hair yeah whatever he says slicks jokes I'm like damn I feel sorry I'm not even mad or
2:19:26
offended cuz I know what I know so I'm looking I'm like damn bro if you was to get it like you're now you now you're
2:19:33
limited right here you're at a ceiling and you're never going to go to the next level until you break that ego that self
2:19:39
like defense that you're putting out there you're never going to get to the next level bro and is this guy is dope
2:19:46
and I'm not I don't I'm not saying this he's not going to pay me and it's not enough money he can pay me because
2:19:53
wisdom is more important than money knowledge the reason why you're perishing is because you have no
2:19:59
knowledge it's not because the government is not this guy holding you back it's because you lack understanding
2:20:04
or awareness that's just what it is once you it's like it's like when you're
2:20:10
looking for something right you're killing yourself like damn what [ __ ] is that what the [ __ ] I put that [ __ ] like
2:20:15
what the hell and then you just you go crazy you put the house upside down you keep looking for it then you go sit down
2:20:22
and you look down like oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] is right in front of my face that's that's how I look at life bro like you
2:20:28
running around like oh my God I get money and the idea just if you settle down and get into the moment the idea is
2:20:36
just right there that can take you to the next level like it's it's in you
2:20:41
like it's in you bro like you don't you don't have to chase anything give me a hand guys that's really [ __ ] thank
2:20:47
you you're welcome BR thank you that's perect thank
2:20:52
you it's amazing to hear different voices and hear what people are are experiencing yeah oh and what you're
2:20:59
saying is awesome and it gets to this subtle aspect of reality that is so hard
2:21:04
to pinpoint it's actually ridiculous so like what you're saying with the light I think about is like the light of
2:21:10
existence that shines on on basically on our souls and what happens is and it's
2:21:17
so crazy you're saying like it's like reflect refracted by the ego cuz I I kind of think about it it's like stained
2:21:23
glassed by ego lies distraction changes in our physiology it's it's it's
2:21:31
crazy I mean and it you just goes way back from the beginning what are you saying about traps and how like there's
2:21:39
all these you say you say altitude you're getting altitude and what you're looking at when you're seeing it from
2:21:46
the universe's perspective from this Cosmic perspective is that you're seeing these deep assumptions inside of
2:21:54
your mind and these are the different frames that Society is putting on you
2:22:01
and like I I'm like I'm I'm in it right now like I'm above the clouds right now
2:22:08
so I can see all these traps that I've been in where like I would allow myself
2:22:13
to have conversations with people that are [ __ ] stupid and that
2:22:19
I don't actually want want to have that don't that don't add to the joy of life
2:22:25
and does doesn't move the doesn't move the ball down the field no towards even just laughter laughter in of itself is
2:22:32
an inv value just laughing is like the leaf laughter is the leaf laughter love
2:22:39
Leaf is life so the it's the beauty of Life the essence of life so even just
2:22:45
basic level laughter is worth a billion dollars a leaf is worth a billion dollars not in a physical Dimension but
2:22:53
in that parallel reality that we also live in and um the light I think the light of
2:23:00
existence it shines and it refle refracts through our ego through like stained glass windows mirrors and
2:23:08
magnifying glasses and it reflects it refracts it so much that we're not able
2:23:14
to let it in just let it how you say land and it's you you get to just this
2:23:21
will the will is something so so deep like what you said to um somewhere over
2:23:28
here where you said it's like if you could just have that good feeling have
2:23:33
that good feeling you You' you want it so bad you give everything you just die for it but there's something more
2:23:40
there's something more that you can't see you can't touch and you can't even really feel almost but it's but it's
2:23:49
beautiful it's Transcendent of this of this whatever
2:23:56
this is whatever it is yeah that's amazing that's [ __ ] amazing so much
2:24:02
thank you oh and you're awesome thank you man content is next level thank you
2:24:07
yeah so and and and I think um just expanding on that is
2:24:14
like you know everybody would take differently what we talked about here and everybody's in we all live in a
2:24:20
different body different mind different perception reality um so even when I say when I hammer you lies upon lies upon
2:24:27
lies upon lies I'm trying to get you to start defragmenting your mind and start
2:24:33
processing just the convenient truths that you have and everybody's going to take that differently a lie to one
2:24:38
person is a truth to another um there's objective reality but there's also what you need to hear for your next step
2:24:45
so when we talk about the boa constrictor it's that
2:24:50
each little thing that you consume that gives you a short-term payoff but lowers access to your will
2:24:58
and you go a little more unconscious little more unconscious little more unconscious little more unconscious
2:25:03
little more unconscious and your discernment starts to go out right and look I started bringing this up because
2:25:10
these were areas that I had a core understanding of for many years my understanding has evolved but my
2:25:16
inspiration was 2020 when I saw what happened in 2020 that was the fruit of years of this like
2:25:24
like it just makes sense 2020 makes sense and it had to happen it and and
2:25:31
you know what's scary about it we've all forgotten about it how many of you does 2020 even still feel real that it happened anymore it's like you're a
2:25:38
trauma victim that got you know something horrible happened to you as like a kid or something and your brain blocked it out why aren't we still
2:25:45
talking about what happened like now that we know what happened we're just going to move past it that's it they
2:25:51
count on us for getting it and and the thing is is that it's it was the it was the
2:25:57
inevitability that at some point the Boa Constructor would just go like that and do that and
2:26:04
um what I'm talking about here and what we're trying to go delve into is an opposite feeling of unconsciousness but
2:26:11
is of Consciousness and in other words your will being Amplified your awake
2:26:16
feelings expanding and you know it's
2:26:22
um I I learned a lot of this from from going out to be honest it sounds so dumb but it's true I would uh you know go out
2:26:29
and maybe you go to talk to someone and you walk up and you want to talk to them and you chicken out and then you walk up
2:26:34
you want to talk to someone you chicken out and you sell yourself out in this sort of uh compounding exponential way
2:26:41
Whoever has ever had that where you you go out you try to talk to people you chicken out chicken out chicken out chicken out chicken out and you go home
2:26:47
with your tail between your legs feel like an idiot you ever had that and you're and you're you're so you're so shut down that you can't even uh you
2:26:54
know function anymore really because you you can't even go say hi at all like your will has been beaten out of you by
2:26:59
your own lack of Integrity to yourself magnified by not keeping your promise to yourself again and again and again right
2:27:06
now have you ever had that feeling where you went out and you know people look at this art form as something like degeneracy because they don't even
2:27:11
understand what we're teaching at all and I understand why they look at it that way but you know instead what you do is you force yourself to go say hi
2:27:18
have a fun interaction goes good goes that either way you congratulate yourselves go say hi go say hi go say hi go say hi and you're 3 4 hours in and
2:27:26
you are buzzing your your mind is absolutely silent you're you're saying
2:27:32
the funniest things you've you didn't know you're that funny you didn't know you're that loud you didn't know that
2:27:37
you're that charismatic you didn't know that it could be that easy it's all so easy who you has ever had that experience based on this kind of work
2:27:44
put your hand way up hand way up okay if you're watching at home it's like way late at night right now that's why this
2:27:49
room is you know kind of we're just like kind of like this is like like we're like punch drunk just like this like a late night drunken talk so this the kind
2:27:56
of talk that happens after like like what what time are we at right now is it like 3:00 in the morning 2: in the morning we're at we're almost right at 2
2:28:02
right so it's just like this is like you ever been like sitting with your friends like in your room and you're talking way too late and you're like half out of it
2:28:08
you start talking nonsense and like doesn't make sense anymore we're there now
2:28:14
so right so you know it's um you know you guys are the ones that stayed here
2:28:20
and didn't didn't go home and go to bed so you're pushing yourself a little bit right but we're trying to stretch so that feeling of will is the same feeling
2:28:27
that when 2020 happens you just look up and you go you're joking really no okay you're joking
2:28:37
really no okay and I said no and I said
2:28:43
No by putting a giant movie theater in my house by building a fulls scale gym in my house and by traveling the country
2:28:51
ever since Co hit I've been traveling the country ever since okay yeah Adventures you know you
2:28:58
see it on my stories and I said no I immediately knew exactly what that was
2:29:04
um it was completely obvious cuz we'd seen it unfolding do you guys remember around 2019 anybody who remember this
2:29:09
I've never said weird crazy stuff like we're in trouble and some stuff's about to go down and right around 2 3 months
2:29:16
before Co I started making videos saying there's some crazy stuff coming we're in trouble anybody happen to remember that and being like what's that about who
2:29:22
here remembers that put your hands might maybe one or to you okay wasn't it funny i' in in 20 years you never heard me
2:29:28
talking like that and I'm like hey heads up buckle up okay what did I know so
2:29:33
imagine my perspective what did I know so imagine my perspective you remember when I put
2:29:39
videos out right when it happened I look so calm what did I know what was my perspective I mean who what kind of
2:29:46
people do I have access to come on guys so it's just so frustrating so who are
2:29:52
my clients right think about it my clients is everybody because I was for many years the top in dating and just
2:29:58
about every guy wants to learn dating and certainly nerdy billionaires want to learn dating so who are my clients guys
2:30:03
wake up what did I know okay there's truly so from that standpoint it's that the
2:30:11
boa coner is coming it's putting you unconscious and you you fight it okay so you fight it you fight it you fight it
2:30:17
you fight it you fight it okay and this is the subtext to you building your business it's the subtext the other
2:30:23
layer to you building social skills it's the other layer to you traveling it's the other layer to you building things is the sh the internal Evolution that's
2:30:31
happening in parallel to you building more basic competencies and practical
2:30:36
skills so sometimes my deeper layer Evolution has evolved beyond my
2:30:42
practical skills other times my practical skills pass my inner Evolution it's going to go in parallel and they catch up to each other so
2:30:50
like uh roots and a tree right the roots and the tree the deeper layers the roots and then you have the tree you don't want to just be all Deep Roots you know
2:30:56
but with a shrubby little tree you don't want to be a giant tree with not deep roots so you you grow them in parallel but the opposite of the Boa Constructor
2:31:04
effect is that effect that you'd get from doing approaches as you feel an amplifying intention an amplifying will
2:31:09
you feel your mind opening up free
2:31:20
you're sharp you're aware you have discernment you have will the other state you are a puppet you can barely do
2:31:26
an approach you're a joke you're a joke you're a joke and I saw that year after
2:31:32
year doing approach because I would see the way I would get on a good night and on a bad night and I was able to see the
2:31:38
differences and H how to lull myself into that state so you know in the same way that you might learn how to like wank off and just learn how to make
2:31:44
yourself reach a certain state to bust a nut in the same way I learned how to uh
2:31:50
train my mind from that to have amplifying um and dramatically increasing intention I just learned it
2:31:55
from that from years of doing it it became a product of meditation so anyway I'd love to hear more uh your thoughts let's crack it out and make sure you
2:32:01
would hear and make sure everybody can hear you you can go you can even go like you can even go like anywhere like that
2:32:07
but just not that okay thanks um yeah so things I've learned today um you know
2:32:14
there's a lot a lot I want to say but we only have so much time I think probably the first and most evid thing is stick
2:32:22
to it um like whether it be your own will whether it be factors of life
2:32:28
whether it be Co literally shutting the world down anything you can think of an injury a family member dying like shit's going to happen but you just always have
2:32:35
to stick with you know that that inner light that inner fire whatever that
2:32:40
thing is that gives it that little bit of gust that amplifies it and I'd imagine for most of you you know the
2:32:47
things you're hearing today whether it be from ow and Julian and Jeff that that's a gust amplifying it follow it
2:32:54
there's other things that do that for you follow that I remember I was at the 2019 4-day self-help event where Sid was
2:33:01
there I think St as a student Pablo was there when that moment happened and it's amazing to see where they are now and it's you know obvious it's partly
2:33:08
because Owen and his teaching but it's because of them the work that they did um and I see that and it makes me very
2:33:14
happy it makes me like really trust this process the amazing things that you know
2:33:20
the level of teaching and being able to bring somebody bring somebody's
2:33:26
potential out that Owen's cultivated and is able to then cultivate in others and this you know this cascading domino
2:33:32
effect that is ultimately going to be the answer to seeing more positive change in the world again you know not
2:33:38
always do we have this ability for one person to change the world there's people who make Great Waves Kobe Gandhi
2:33:44
JFK Owen to a degree I'd love to see what else is going to happen in his life
2:33:50
but the thing is like you know it's really now yeah it it's really you know
2:33:57
sometimes it's really really hard to see you know any chance for a positive and
2:34:03
it's because these negative forces in the world negative people in the world they want to see it snuffed out they
2:34:10
want you to think it's not possible but it is and even small actions just
2:34:16
spreading it from you to one person that's all you have to do over the time of your life life whether it be a stranger whether it be your child
2:34:22
whether it be you know some small interaction like it's extremely powerful
2:34:28
it's the compounding effect and while you may not think that you know any action you take even the words that
2:34:33
passed by tonight maybe you forget them just let some piece of it stick with you I know it's going to stick with me um
2:34:41
and [ __ ] man like yeah I guess that's thank you
2:34:47
brother nice hello guys um so first of all mind my
2:34:54
English I came from Chris a couple of months ago so sound great thank you very much um one reason I got up is just
2:35:00
because all throughout all this time I was thinking of doing it and I was like kind of you know chicken out so I was
2:35:07
like yeah I have to do this just to feel better about myself second of all I I want to share what I got from this whole
2:35:14
thing which I think for me is very important like um in with my words I I
2:35:19
think uh what Owen was talking about and the other guys were speed of implementation like when you have the
2:35:27
Instinct of you have to do something go actually do it if you think of course that is the right thing to do do it
2:35:34
don't have second thoughts uh another area that I saw this a lot that it was
2:35:39
the thing you said about approaching when you like The Compound Effect of not approaching this not not approaching now
2:35:45
and that builds up and you end up going home hating yourself that is like the worst feeling for me and I noticed the
2:35:52
exact opposite happening when I was just instantly like whenever I was like
2:35:57
getting out out of the bus and I see like a um a beautiful woman that I wanted to talk when I talk to her
2:36:04
instantly the whole [ __ ] day was going just the way it should be you know and yeah that that's it guys like for me
2:36:13
whenever I see something that I have to do like I think it I have to do it I'm going to do it at the best of my ability
2:36:20
yeah that's it so the way the way that I think about what he's saying is like thank you it's like an it's a like it's thank yeah give him a hand thank you
2:36:27
yeah I was going to let you say some more too but that's good so I think of that like a little baby will you know
2:36:33
I'm going to get up like okay so this is kind of like a funny thing right but
2:36:40
when when we get it where you know we do seminars right and somebody maybe you
2:36:46
know they gather the courage to come up and I see they're nervous to come up and just
2:36:52
share if you've been just driving yourself your whole life just
2:36:57
brutalizing driving yourself and you see someone where they're nervous to do that
2:37:02
it it looks sort of surreal you're like how could that even be hard that's how I
2:37:08
feel but I also recognize that it's not the age of the person because that's
2:37:14
still like they say age is just a number there's a chronological age at which you begin waking up and that could could be
2:37:19
at age five that could be at age 55 could be age 105 in theory I guess but
2:37:25
the chronological age is not as important right so when I see you come up here and you like how old are you
2:37:32
chronologically 33 33 but when I see you come up here I see you as
2:37:37
two in your will I Found the courage to come up now you may have a great will in
2:37:43
other areas by the way not just public speaking you know I mean you know be tough for me to do a uh you know Wings suiting or something you know so
2:37:49
everything's a little different so it's not Perfect Analogy but I see you beginning to to develop that and what
2:37:55
did it and and just even hop back up for one second what did it feel like you know in your in your body to get
2:38:01
yourself to drive yourself to come up and to share for a second what kind of feelings do you have yeah I mean even
2:38:06
now I feel myself shaking that yeah like but that light but that but that light
2:38:11
that's there that pushes through the shaking and and Zone in on that and find yourself there yeah I know that at the
2:38:19
end of the day I'm going to like for me even though this is not for most of people wait but pause find yourself
2:38:26
actually do it fi find yourself shift your awareness and find yourself in that
2:38:32
point that drove yourself up here sink into it right I look at me in the eye
2:38:39
yeah sink into it that
2:38:46
will yep okay look at the audience
2:38:52
go louder louder
2:38:59
louder louder relax yourself not force but
2:39:07
Power relax yourself go now I'm blasted from being up here for many hours
2:39:12
but just like but don't go my volume's a little shattered right now cuz I've been up here for a couple days but just go
2:39:18
just give it to me crispy where you're not forcing it and you're letting it move through you I
2:39:24
need it crispy High Fidelity okay cuz what you're doing now as you're forcing it that's now do you guys remember I
2:39:30
said the source of will so see we tapped out and maxed out his source of will
2:39:36
through his ego and through his brain but now we've seen the limit of that fuel and we can feel the usage of
2:39:44
fuel in the Fidelity in the voice so shift the fuel
2:39:49
presence presence
2:39:55
shifts now as you go in a more meditative state in a state of release
2:40:00
like uh like die look at me you're dead dead dead dead look in the audience yell
2:40:11
again how much louder is that for people at home to tell them how much louder was it a lot you're dead dead dead dead
2:40:22
dead now we'll go longer okay we're going to we're going to stretch it out okay dead dead dead
2:40:34
[Music]
2:40:39
dead your life's over you're [ __ ] dead Mane [ __ ]
2:40:46
dead you're [ __ ] dead
2:40:54
[Music] keep going no more keep going let it
2:41:02
[Music] out again
2:41:16
[Music] by the in the sound now I'm rock from
2:41:23
being up for so many days but for him he's not up for many days where it sounds crisp is when he's in presence
2:41:29
and then where it goes like that the fidelity thing that's where he's using the wrong fuel so he's about 70 80% in
2:41:36
presence and little spurts in where he goes in ego and tries to control it that is true yeah but if you allow and you
2:41:42
can feel it as you're switching fuel allow the mind to drop in drop drop
2:41:51
drop
2:41:57
drop go into trance you're in a [ __ ] trance man okay go in a [ __ ] trance
2:42:03
you understand the [ __ ] eternity you're in a [ __ ]
2:42:09
tr okay the [ __ ] eternity you're in a [ __ ] tr hey
2:42:22
you're here forever you're here forever again again
2:42:34
again drop [Applause]
2:42:40
in allow it you have to allow see I'm cracking because I've been up here so many days but that that's enough days up
2:42:46
but you haven't been up here for days Al you are pushing hard right now okay I want you to drop drop drop okay
2:42:56
drop drop okay drop okay drop
2:43:04
it okay okay keep going keep going [Music]
2:43:24
you don't [Music] exist you don't
2:43:34
exist there's nothing to fear you're already dead man there's nothing to fear
2:43:41
there's only right now [Music]
2:43:59
it
2:44:12
[Music]
2:44:23
again give my hand guys this very very good thank you okay
2:44:29
so so drop into drop into beyond the mind okay just drop into it and then see
2:44:37
how it the the floodgates go like that and then you see how your mind opens up
2:44:43
lateral thinking opens up High Fidelity opens up Can you feel it yeah I kind of
2:44:48
uh different like stages of the of the process of shouting this kind of feel
2:44:54
going to the like you know aware not feeling anything like being there and
2:45:00
then all of a sudden I feel some type of you know distractions and I feel it in my voice
2:45:06
too so the voice manifests what's happening inside right yeah how do you how do you feel a part of yourself that
2:45:13
maybe you didn't recognize before there's a part of yourself in there a little seed that you can water
2:45:20
yeah I mean uh there was a there was a point like I I kind of there was a
2:45:26
thought in my mind okay I'm a baller now you know it is fun it is funny but um it
2:45:33
is something that I [ __ ] love man and although I do understand it I still see
2:45:38
that the social conditioning and thing it makes you you know like this and I
2:45:43
the boa can and you just go you give up the the will just die fuses right if we
2:45:50
had the needle example like the super Platinum titanium alien alloy needle
2:45:57
that's so dense and amazing that the whe just goes like that and uh you know you
2:46:04
just um evaporate and it and they take your soul out of your body actually they take
2:46:10
it right out of your body and you're just this corpse walking around and it
2:46:15
is crazy that you can most of us can can understand that can can like we are aware of of what of that part you know
2:46:22
that we are kind of something is bothering us but we're not taking the
2:46:27
action to fight it you know to do something about it and that's the worst part I mean it's a different thing when
2:46:33
you don't know you have something and you're doing it at the end of you don't know that you have it so you feel good
2:46:40
but when you know you have it and you don't do something about it you feel like [ __ ] man you know you hate yourself
2:46:48
and then you and then you self-medicate distract yeah yeah lowers your will even
2:46:55
more you're not even you're not even a human look you know it look at yourself
2:47:00
and look as you walk down the street what do you see but we just normalize this I feel like a lot of men that's the
2:47:07
main reason of their addictions whatever the addiction is like drugs video games
2:47:13
drinking it's like trying to kill that that inner powerful C
2:47:19
our inner power s that saying you're better than that man you can do that why
2:47:25
won't why are why are you not doing it and and it's many people it's also many
2:47:30
people who would say that it was only through God that they were able to find healing in that because they were
2:47:35
sourcing sourcing sourcing sourcing toxic energy and only when they hit rock
2:47:42
bottom were they ready to switch where they sourc their energy from and have that light beam come in and cleanse them
2:47:47
of all the parasitic sickening demonic luciferian poison and then they had a
2:47:53
new source of energy and were able to step forward and step into their next
2:47:59
level yep thank you very much Owen thank you bro that was awesome thank you
2:48:06
amazing what I would say is whatever chunks out of this that you're able to
2:48:12
let land it's like a little seed planted in there you come to trainings like this
2:48:18
to get out of day-to-day thinking and that moment that you get out of
2:48:24
day-to-day thinking means that you can correct the ship and where it's going and that's both internal and and external okay guys so I want to thank
2:48:31
you guys for being here all day today and I'm going to send you guys home and get some sleep okay thank you
2:48:36
