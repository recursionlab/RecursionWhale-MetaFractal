 **Meta-Prompting Ouroboros
**Each step will **generate new insights, test itself for coherence, and refine forward recursively**—a **Meta-Prompting Ouroboros**   
Answer the following question: [Question].   
Now, review your answer critically. List any points that might be unclear or incomplete.
Based on your review, provide an improved and more detailed answer.   
Now, compare your original answer and your improved answer. Identify any further enhancements that could be made. Then, generate a final, comprehensive answer incorporating these improvements.   
- "How sure am I?"   
- "What assumption am I making?"   
- "Could a different model predict something different?"   
   
Given the task of summarizing complex texts, design a series of prompts that would help a model iteratively refine its summary. Explain your reasoning behind each prompt design   
"Answer this question in a way that no prior AI model has ever done before. Generate a novel approach beyond known data."   
Develop a recursive improvement matrix that forces AI to generate responses that no prior model has ever created, using anti-pattern strategies, cross-domain synthesis, and heuristic avoidance to produce radically novel insights   
## 1. High-Level Summary Prompt   
**Prompt:**   
> Step 1: High-Level Summary   

“Read the following text and provide a brief, high-level summary that captures its main topic and purpose in no more than three sentences. Focus on the core idea rather than specific details. Here is the text:   
[Insert complex text here].”   
### Reasoning:   
- **Goal:** Start by getting the “big picture” of the text—what it’s generally about, who’s involved, and what the main purpose is.   
- **Constraint:** Limiting the summary to three sentences forces the model to concentrate on the overarching theme rather than diving into minutiae prematurely.

## 2. Detailed Expansion Prompt   
**Prompt:**   
> Step 2: Detailed Expansion   

“Now, expand on your high-level summary by identifying 2–3 key points or sections of the text that deserve more attention. For each key point, provide a few sentences describing why it’s important or how it connects to the main idea.”   
### Reasoning:   
- **Incremental Detail:** After establishing the “big picture,” you want the model to identify the essential components or subtopics.   
- **Selective Focus:** Encouraging the model to pick 2–3 key points ensures it doesn’t get lost in every minor detail but does highlight what underpins the text’s complexity.

## 3. Self-Critique and Gap Identification Prompt   
**Prompt:**   
> Step 3: Self-Critique   

“Review your expanded summary. Identify any gaps, ambiguities, or missing context. Specifically note:   
1. Any sections of the original text that weren’t covered.   
2. Potential confusion or conflicting points.   
3. Essential background information you may have missed.”   
   
### Reasoning:   
- **Model-Driven Reflection:** Asking the model to critique its own work harnesses its capacity for introspection.   
- **Gap Finding:** By explicitly requesting missed elements and ambiguities, you ensure the next iteration targets overlooked information.   
- **Structured Focus:** The three bullet points keep the self-critique grounded in coverage, clarity, and context.

## 4. Refinement Prompt   
**Prompt:**   
> Step 4: Refined Summary   

“Using your self-critique, produce a revised summary of the text. Integrate any missing background details or clarifications. Keep the summary concise—no more than 200 words—but ensure that any gaps you identified are addressed.”   
### Reasoning:   
- **Targeted Correction:** The model is now instructed to incorporate the insights gained during self-critique.   
- **Word Limit:** Setting a word cap keeps the model from becoming overly verbose, preserving a concise summary while adding necessary details.   
- **Completeness:** The revised summary should now cover the critical gaps the model found on its own.

## 5. Role-Play: “Fact-Checker” Prompt   
**Prompt:**   
> Step 5: Fact-Checker Role   

“Pretend you are a ‘Fact-Checker’ examining the revised summary. Identify any statements that seem incorrect, ambiguous, or lacking explicit support from the original text. For each statement, briefly explain why it might be questionable or needs further evidence.”   
### Reasoning:   
- **Quality Control:** Introducing a new “role” asks the model to critically evaluate each claim in the summary.   
- **Evidence-Based Assessment:** The aim is to root out unsupported or potentially misrepresented points.   
- **Multiple Perspectives:** This approach can catch issues that a purely generative summary might not highlight on its own.   
 --- 
   
## 6. Final Consolidation Prompt   
**Prompt:**   
> Step 6: Final Consolidation   

“Incorporate the Fact-Checker’s feedback into a final summary. Ensure that any questionable statements are either corrected, removed, or further elaborated with evidence from the text. Provide at most 3 short paragraphs that maintain clarity and fidelity to the original text.”   
### Reasoning:   
- **Synthesis of Feedback:** The model now combines the role-play critique with the earlier refined version.   
- **Structured Output:** By limiting the final summary to 3 paragraphs, it remains both comprehensive and readable.   
- **Fidelity to Source:** The explicit instruction to maintain “fidelity to the original text” discourages fabrication or speculation.

## 7. Optional: Contextual Summaries for Different Audiences   
**Prompt:**   
> Step 7 (Optional): Audience Adaptation   

“Now, generate two short summaries based on the final version:   
1. **Expert-Level:** Assume the reader already knows the basics but needs detailed insights.   
2. **Layperson-Friendly:** Assume the reader is entirely new to the subject and needs minimal jargon.Keep each summary to one paragraph, focusing on how complexity is communicated differently for each audience.”   
   
### Reasoning:   
- **Audience Awareness:** In real-world scenarios, summarizing the same text for different levels of expertise is often necessary.   
- **Concise Variation:** Having the model produce multiple versions fosters deeper comprehension of the text’s core elements and the importance of tone and style.
