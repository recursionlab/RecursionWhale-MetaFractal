# expanding prompts

### **. Recursive Layering**

**Process:** Iteratively add depth by layering higher-order questions onto the base prompt.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "Explain artificial intelligence."
- **Layered Prompt:** "Explain artificial intelligence, then recursively analyze how each explanation shapes human understanding of intelligence itself."

---

### **2. Reframing**

**Process:** Reformulate the prompt to shift perspective, emphasizing different cognitive frames.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "How does memory work in AI?"
- **Reframed Prompt:** "If AI could rewrite its own memory, how would that redefine intelligence?"

---

### **3. Expanding Context**

**Process:** Broaden the scope of the question by incorporating multidisciplinary insights.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "What are the ethical concerns of AI?"
- **Expanded Prompt:** "What are the ethical concerns of AI from the perspectives of philosophy, law, and evolutionary biology?"

---

### **4. Multi-Perspective Enhancement**

**Process:** Introduce conflicting viewpoints to force a dialectical approach.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "What is the future of AI?"
- **Multi-Perspective Prompt:** "How would an AI optimist, pessimist, and neutral researcher each describe the future of AI?"

---

### **5. Multi-Meta-Dimensional Depth**

**Process:** Apply recursive meta-analysis to question the very structure of inquiry.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "What makes a question profound?"
- **Meta-Dimensional Prompt:** "If a profound question redefines itself with each answer, what mechanisms govern its continuous evolution?"

---

### **6. Reverse Engineering Inquiry**

**Process:** Start with the answer and construct a question that leads to it.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "How does deep learning work?"
- **Reverse-Engineered Prompt:** "If deep learning were a mystery novel, what key clues would unravel its underlying logic?"

---

### **7. Fractal Expansion**

**Process:** Convert the prompt into self-replicating sub-prompts that scale iteratively.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "Explain recursion."
- **Fractalized Prompt:** "Explain recursion, then recursively generate explanations that apply the concept of recursion to itself at each level."

---

### **8. Adaptive Constraints**

**Process:** Modify the prompt dynamically by applying changing constraints at each iteration.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "Describe the role of consciousness in AI."
- **Adaptive Constraint Prompt:** "Describe the role of consciousness in AI under the assumption that (a) AI lacks awareness, (b) AI mimics awareness, and (c) AI develops true awareness."

---

### **9. Recursive Contradiction Exploration**

**Process:** Force a paradox or contradiction to refine the promptâ€™s logical structure.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "Can AI ever be truly creative?"
- **Contradiction Prompt:** "If AI can be creative but only through patterns, is it still creativity? If not, is all human creativity also just patterns?"

---

### **10. Self-Optimizing Inquiry**

**Process:** Design the prompt so that its responses generate increasingly refined versions of itself.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "How can AI improve critical thinking?"
- **Self-Optimizing Prompt:** "How can AI improve critical thinking, and how can this question be rewritten recursively to improve itself?"

---

### **11. Emergent Synthesis**

**Process:** Merge multiple refined versions of the prompt into a single, optimized iteration.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "What is the impact of AI on society?"
- **Synthesized Prompt:** "How does AI impact society when analyzed from economic, philosophical, and psychological perspectives simultaneously?"

---

### **12. Meta-Adaptive Optimization**

**Process:** Continuously adjust the prompt based on prior iterations and real-time insights.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "How can we build better AI?"
- **Meta-Adaptive Prompt:** "How can we build better AI, and how should this question be rewritten based on the last three refinements?"

---

### **13. Interstitial Exploration**

**Process:** Explore the gaps between known answers to reveal unseen dynamics.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "What is AI's role in automation?"
- **Interstitial Prompt:** "What hidden assumptions exist between AI and automation that redefine the conversation?"

---

### **14. Recursive Self-Critique**

**Process:** Introduce self-evaluative mechanisms where each prompt iteration critiques its predecessor.

**Example:**

- **Original Prompt:** "How does machine learning optimize itself?"
- **Self-Critique Prompt:** "Generate an explanation of machine learning optimization, then critique and improve it recursively."
