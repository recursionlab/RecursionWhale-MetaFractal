so today my goal is I want to give you a specific protocol of what to focus on
0:05
and exactly what to do now I want you to be very very very attentive here you will listen to exactly what I tell you
0:11
to do and if you do anything other than what I tell you to do you will mess up okay why do I say that with such
0:17
conviction because for 22 years as of this moment and it'll be more later I have tweaked this algorithm tweak tweak
0:24
tweak tweak tweak tweak tweak to get it down to freaking Perfection so I
0:29
understand social skills and social life at eye level so here's how you want to think about it okay so the first step is
0:34
you've got to recognize who you are what your value is and what is your version
0:40
and I say this jokingly but it's to get you thinking of your own version the bronze plan the silver plan the gold
0:45
plan and the Platinum plan okay so you've got to have an understanding of what each of those plans are okay let me
0:52
give an example with me with my videos as an example the bronze plan is you just watch my videos from home the
1:00
silver plan is you come out to a free event then the gold plan would be maybe
1:06
we do some kind of mentoring over Zoom or the phone and the Platinum plan is I take you out by the [ __ ] hand out
1:13
into social interactions and I show you exactly how to meet people exactly how to socialize I show you every single
1:20
thing to do and focus completely on you for an entire weekend or longer or whatever we decide to do okay so I
1:26
understand where each of those plans is I'm going to give to every everybody I give gracefully and in a nice way in
1:33
video format to everyone I give free events to some people maybe some Zoom
1:38
events to other people and in person to other people at each level that someone invests in me I invest back in them so I
1:45
know where each of those levels are and then I also know that if someone is not engaging with me [ __ ] them wish them the
1:52
best in reality but for all intents and purposes [ __ ] them and goodbye I am not trying to befriend somebody who does not
1:58
value what it is that I bring I'm not chasing anyone's approval I am not caught up in engaging with people
2:04
who do not engage with me I wish them the best I understand I'm not for everybody or everyone's cup of tea but I
2:09
engage with those who engage with me I get that okay so when you're chasing somebody who does not value you you are
2:17
giving away your soul a little piece of your soul is being ripped out of your body and handed to them have you ever
2:23
had it as a simple example where maybe you had an ex who you love so much like you love your ex so much you would do
2:29
anything for them but maybe at some point they no longer saw the vision in you they just didn't anymore right like you know they loved you at one point and
2:35
that was real but then at a certain point they didn't and they had moved on and then you beg them back and after
2:40
begging them back with all of your soul because you love them so much at the end of it you felt drained out like it's
2:46
like your soul was drained out of your body but they kind of weirdly got a lot of validation off of it and they got a
2:51
very big head from it it's like they took your soul and they ate it who has ever had an experience of that put your hand up high if you've had that done
2:58
okay yeah look at like you just beg and beg and beg maybe at one point they loved you you beg and beg and beg and
3:03
the more that you beg the more that you feel your soul ripped out of your body and the more that they get a big head
3:09
many of you also when you meet people in public because you're going about it the wrong way when it goes bad you almost
3:15
feel like a piece of souls taken out of your body you feel like crap the rejection feels like crap because you
3:21
you engage with them in a way that was giving away too much of yourself you gave away too much of yourself okay I'll
3:27
show you ways to meet people where you're not give You're vulnerable and you're open and you're authentic and you're real but you're not being a freak
3:35
that just hands your soul to them to be eaten that's weird but you don't know that you're doing it I'll show you how
3:40
okay and it's counterintuitive but it's rather simple so we'll get there in a minute okay now um so understand here's
3:48
what you want to do if you have someone in your life significant other somebody who you work with somebody you network
3:55
with an employer a staff whatever you have a version of that that you give
4:02
of yourself that is the Platinum plan I love if it's if it's a romantic partner baby I love you you're my life you're my
4:10
world you're my everything I give you my everything I spend my time with you
4:16
could be exclusive what may not be whatever is your Arrangement but whatever it is for you you are giving of
4:22
that and you give fully and you're loving and you open your
4:28
heart but if they get to the point where their version of being receptive of that is to
4:35
nag to criticize to be mean and to shut you down do not keep giving more and more
4:44
and more and more and more simply recognize this is no longer a fit this
4:50
doesn't fit anymore the way that you want to think about this is I love you baby or say that it's an employer I'm
4:56
here for you I'm here for your vision I'm here to help you build your vision say that it's a staff I'm here to be a
5:02
great leader I'm here to help you get paid I'm here to help you get raises I'm here to go to the promised land if it's somebody who you network with or a
5:08
friend hey I'm a great friend I'm here for you I love you we're homies and you [ __ ] do that [ __ ] so that's how you
5:15
are that's the Platinum plan and what you want to do is as long as someone is good to you you want to be good to them
5:23
now let's say that you get to a point where that person is no longer able have a seat if
5:30
you'd like to yeah that person is no longer able to be that way for you well
5:36
what I've done and I bet you a lot of you guys have done this is what do you do you double down you ever do that you
5:42
ever double down so I've I've had relationships before where maybe I love that girl so much now you ask any of
5:47
those girls they'll say no he didn't he didn't love me what you know they're going to say that that's fine that's how it works right we all know but you know
5:53
they're not in my brain they're not psychic these are women that I love so much and then you know maybe I just
5:59
wasn't quite uh you know I wasn't that guy anymore for whatever reason you know what I mean
6:05
I just wasn't that guy we all have to learn like I believe every guy has to go through this I think girls go through this I think everybody goes through this
6:10
and now all of a sudden they kind of pull back and they uh complain a lot and and you know you try to do nice things
6:16
and they're not having it right so you have to have a clear boundary of where
6:22
you stand like what behavior is okay and what behavior is not okay and then you
6:27
have to have a protocol where if that relationship whether it's professional romantic friendship networking a staff a
6:34
boss an employee whatever you have to have a protocol that you're clear on of how to try to resolve it that's conflict
6:39
resolution that doesn't mean okay that's where books like repeat this after me crucial conversations convers nonviolent
6:46
communication um Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus r books okay you want to
6:52
learn about conflict resolution cuz I think too many people always talking about boundaries and standards which is
6:58
amazing but how about resolution right how about resolution [ __ ] all these [ __ ] telling you you just kind
7:04
to have a standard and a boundary never talking about a maybe you should learn to appreciate that person more not just
7:10
cut them off so there's sort of a a there's sort of a middle ground between the two right what is like not enough
7:15
boundaries the other is too much of a boundary right one is staying in a toxic relationship the other is running away
7:21
there's sort of a a middle ground that you want to find I I think that there's a lot of people that run away from people that love them and they're worse
7:26
off for it you know I've SE I've seen people that you know claiming standards and boundaries left my life and they'll
7:32
say their life got better but you look him in the eye you know that's not true so they played the boundaries card when
7:37
they should have played the resolution card but they weren't able to and that's fine sad but it's what happens so try to
7:43
have gratitude for people don't just complain about people all the time don't be pissed all the time focus on what you loving people focus on being grateful
7:50
for people but also recognize when maybe they just ain't feeling it anymore you know and understand like a significant
7:56
other who complains all the time who's negative all the time who can't enjoy the day that's not a significant other
8:02
that's a liability and unfortunately sometimes people hit a point where they're not willing to break out of that in other words like a lot of
8:07
relationships that kind of go like this awesome awesome awesome okay okay okay and then right down to Hell okay and
8:13
they get that momentum it's like a runaway train going down a hill and do baby I love you please let's let's not
8:18
let's not be get into it like this like what do we got to do and there's no there's no goal post the goal post is permanately moving it's a state of
8:24
discontent and you just they're just out of your frame and that's it and it's done okay and that's that's it who here
8:30
has experienced that where you just cannot fix a relationship no matter how much you try and how much you love the person put your hand up that's you put
8:35
it way up put it way up okay so we got a lot of people experien that isn't that sad right has you know for you guys that
8:41
have experienced that isn't that sad you love the person like I [ __ ] love you like what the [ __ ] would it take for us to be to be happy
8:47
but it is what it is and it's I've had it professionally I've had it romantically I've had it in friends it's
8:53
life that's part of life so my failure in the past was I didn't have a protocol
8:58
of where is my limit and now as I'm older I know when it is time to resolve
9:05
and how to try to resolve and to try my best and I know where there is a limit and where they are not looking for
9:11
resolution because some people just want to see the world burn guys and they may
9:16
be very nice on the front end because they like you but later they're not so much so once that happens you have to
9:23
take that love for them that that absolute love for them and you have to divert that love and what you have to do
9:30
instead is is you want to take that love and put it into your process of engaging
9:36
with new people I want you to imagine someone who you love so much or maybe a staff member you love so much or maybe a boss that you love so much or maybe a
9:42
friend who you love so much okay think about this right isn't that hard to walk away hard to walk away right but you
9:49
have to know what you'll do a if you want to resolve which could mean doubling down
9:55
on being nicer or B what it means to walk way and what you'll do you have to
10:00
have an understanding of this okay where these lines are so you have to know exactly what it is that you're going to
10:06
do when you walk now I'm going to explain something to you that's very very very subtle okay but it's very
10:12
important that you understand this okay I think that one of the greatest ways to understand the way that things are
10:17
valued is is looking at art or looking at luxury goods looking at luxury cars
10:23
or looking at luxury watches um watches as a simple example I give I give the
10:28
example of watches quite a bit I a couple fancy watches and watches are so funny because if you look at the most
10:33
expensive Rolex or autm RP gay or pek Philipe watches or Richard Mill watches
10:39
a Richard Mill watch which is about 300 Grand is not that different from a G-Shock it's actually not a g-shock's
10:45
like a 100 bucks couple expensive G-Shocks like a thousand bucks but you know nothing like that right have you guys ever seen a Richard mil watch put
10:51
your hand up if you ever seen Richard mil watch couple you guys you guys all know what Rolex is okay right did you guys know that
10:58
with Rolex watches even the Dow color determines the price so for example there there's if you have a roll uh a
11:04
gold Daytona look pull your phone out look this up right now I want to make this real do look up gold Daytona black
11:10
dial okay gold Daytona black dial what kind of prices do you see okay and these prices go up and down they they
11:16
fluctuate based on the watch market so gold dayona black doll what do you see how much is
11:22
that, they're at 70 now cuz it used to be about 30 I see 36000 yeah 36 but
11:28
again it depends which one okay so typical gold di Daytona is 36k look up Green di gold Daytona okay 400,000 no it
11:37
shouldn't be 400 yeah gold di Daytona should be anywhere from 80 to 120 might
11:42
get a really old one for 70 green D Daytona gold Daytona 90,000
11:47
90,000 okay so guys why is one Daytona a black d 30,000 and then a green do
11:54
Daytona almost 100,000 why is that scarc what's that scar rare
12:01
rare scarce can't have it so for example if you go to get a
12:07
basic level Royal Oak from otmar um they will interview you will have to write an
12:13
essay of why you like the brand you'll have to set up okay and now this is to be Alo now first of all most of you guys
12:19
can't even get it but let's say that you had a tiny chance to get so do you think that if you walk into Rolex or into
12:24
otomar or pek with 100 Grand you go plunk you put down 100 Grand you think they'll sell you watch
12:30
no they won't S you watch right now you go to automar you try to get a new which
12:36
probably I there's probably not a single person in this room that would get it but let's say that you could you'd write an essay you'd say why you like it then
12:42
you'd go in for appointment number one they would vet you then you go in for appointment number two they'd vet you
12:48
and after maybe four appointments you'd have a slim chance to be put on a waiting list of about a year and then you'd be allocated a watch now what does
12:55
allocated a watch mean allowed to buy allowed to give them 100
13:01
Grand allocated a watch okay here's what you have to understand something like
13:08
this this gold day Daytona here is maybe a thousand bucks in gold
13:14
at the most at the most the gold is nothing the production on this ain't [ __ ] this thing is less good than an
13:21
Apple Watch I've got a Royal Oak I'll wear it tomorrow if you guys want okay that
13:27
watch also is literally not even as good as a watch that you get at like
13:32
Nordstrom it's true the only thing good about it is what scarcity scarcity what's the what
13:40
what makes an automar good value holds value increases increases right it's it's like an nft watch this like the
13:45
original nfts like the original uh board ape you know the board ape you guys know that one the board ape nft okay right
13:52
you pay like what how much were those board Apes how much were they they were like 120 120 what okay 120,000 for Gra
13:59
of an ape okay Steph Curry had one I think um
14:06
that nft Trend might come back someday if the metaverse took off so you see um if you want to understand value study
14:14
luxury watches study luxury goods um realize why people buy this stuff the
14:19
only reason why an AP watch is expensive is only because you can't have it that's
14:25
it you can't have it and then what it says about you if you do that's it okay
14:34
so that is what makes people value something is the fact that other people get told no other people get told no
14:43
this is a free event right here okay this room tomorrow will be half the crowd size this event you'd pay five
14:50
grand for if I wasn't doing it for free but half this crowd will be gone tomorrow half of you in this room will
14:55
be gone tomorrow why will half of you in this room be gone tomorrow cuz that certainly never happened on an infield training free I never had someone leave
15:02
an infield training I never had someone leave the boot camp in fact at the boot camp I could run till 7 a.m. the next
15:08
day some do I run until noon funny nobody leaves but somehow magically by
15:14
Magic it's a magic magic magic on a free event by day two the room is half empty
15:20
I sometimes do four- Day events and then by the third day it's half of that and or and then by the last day the fourth
15:25
day it is half of that room starts off at 400 200 100 and 50 or 60 by day four everybody
15:33
there you ask them like if I would ask you guys has this event so far and say this for the crowd watching at home this
15:39
free event so far has this been the most amazing expectation exceeding event you could have possibly imagin so far what
15:46
would you tell people back at home anybody say no like how much better
15:52
is this than you even would expect once you came here how much energy and passion have I given you since I walked in this room have I could I could I have given
15:59
you a shred more of myself when I walked in this room okay and it's
16:04
free but yet somehow this room will be half empty tomorrow I know that when I do free events okay do you understand
16:09
that I know this with the room booking the way that I set up the room booking is in accordance with that because it's
16:15
a free event there are people in the city who will hear about this event and not show up because it is a free event
16:23
and by the way I do free events because I like doing free associative public speaking and I like to experiment so
16:28
that's why I do them completely free it gives me a license to rant um when I do a paid event it's about you it's
16:34
structured it's exercise oriented and it's feedback and personal feedback driven but at a free event I can rant
16:40
and I can do experiments that's why I do free events but that's for me so by the way if I was trying to do the best event for you would I do it for free or would
16:46
I charge I I know you don't believe this in your mind you don't understand the concept fully yet if I cared mostly
16:53
about you I would charge if I care about me I'll do a free event recorded black
16:59
on YouTube get a gazillion views and that's why I'm doing it but if it was for you I'd get you to pay if it was for
17:04
you I would sell you effectively on it get you to pay so you pay [ __ ] attention if it's just for me and I just
17:10
need a quick crowd on a whim and I want to take it anywhere be experimental I'll do a free event we'll do a great free
17:15
event it'll be [ __ ] sick but um you won't get the same value because you didn't pay that's the [ __ ] truth okay
17:20
so this is true I I know you guys don't understand this this is hard when you don't get this it's hard to understand
17:26
once you get it it'll be so obvious so study luxury watches study luxury goods
17:33
go to the art G the beautiful art galleries here in Chicago study luxury cars look here's what you guys don't
17:38
realize even a Lamborghini is a piece of [ __ ] you just don't understand
17:45
Lamborghinis as far as I know do not even go as fast as electric cars now is that true I heard that from somebody is that true anyone know who's a car guy in
17:50
here any Car Guys in here any car guys is that that's true yeah so so like a electric can go faster than Lambo at
17:56
this point so a Lambo is is this unnecessarily complicated luxury good
18:02
that then they attach to exclusivity by making the process hard so like a a watch like this basically probably takes
18:08
like a couple grand every couple years to do upkeep on it if you drop it it's [ __ ] um it it took like a year to make
18:16
at Rolex but the process is a dated is an outdated process it's not a good
18:22
process they're like let's use a process from the 1700s that sucks call it
18:29
hology make it expensive and then we can charge people out the ass for it at you can't buy a Rolex Rolex doesn't sell a
18:36
watch they sell the list they go we put they sell you to be put on a list they make you wait to get the Rolex once they
18:43
say yes to you and they probably won't but once they say yes then you get to buy the shitty Rolex they get you to
18:50
purchase the Rolex that you don't want that'll only be 10 or 20K then they say you can buy the less shitty Rolex
18:55
that'll be 30k then you buy the less shitty Rolex at the price goes up from there until you're eventually allowed to
19:01
get the Daytona or in the pek case the Nautilus so if you go into pek you say I want a nautilus they go no no you must
19:07
become a friend of pek we had to become friends before I give you the [ __ ] watch and you're thinking like no I
19:13
thought if I get the money I just go they're going to say no they're going to say no to my money here's what you need to understand the watch is worthless
19:20
this watch is virtually worthless so as soon as they would sell it to you right
19:25
away what would happen to their business they have no
19:31
business the belief that they could just sell it here's what you're not getting okay here's the pie you don't get the
19:37
belief that you could just sell it assumes that there's value inherently when there's not there's no inherent
19:44
value in the watch there's only the perceived value of the scarcity
19:49
mechanism like with some art pieces it's just the perceived scarcity even the Lamborghini they make this over
19:55
complicated car it's too CL have you ever been to one it's too close to the ground it makes you feel nauseous the damn car farts it farts guys it's a
20:01
farting car the car [ __ ] farts okay okay yeah it's uncomfortable it farts so they make the hardest to create
20:08
car possible make it fart Make It Low the ground make it have high maintenance and then people feel status when you get
20:14
in it so people associate it to status okay by the way I wear nice watches no woman knows what this watch is okay no
20:21
woman has any clue what any watch is the if a woman knew what one nice watch is it' be like a 10K date just because
20:27
that's just the kind that she's commonly seen and even then they don't know okay I've never had a woman recognize my watch you know who recognizes watches
20:32
rich men okay so it's great for networking with rich men but and you
20:38
could Network without it for rich men I got plenty of rich clients why I didn't have a watch but it's uh what happens with watches is you go out and you'll
20:44
see a dude with like another expensive watch you go oh cool watch bro and they go oh what kind of watch do you have you go I have this watch they go I have this
20:50
watch oh cool what do you do what do you do and then you sell on a one-onone and I do this all the time how do you think
20:55
I pay the bills so you guys get your [ __ ] free tour okay cuz [ __ ] it ain't cheap okay so that guy that I get out
21:01
there nice watch nice watch let's [ __ ] um that okay yeah the watch the watch
21:08
game's funny too cuz like literally if you have a better watch than them they're like oh you beat me it's like a Pokemon game or something it's bizarre
21:14
so got a rare watch but anyway that's that's networking with with with with men right women don't even know what it
21:20
is women want like shiny things furry things um I got this new pink and yellow jacket I put in live recently you guys
21:26
see that oh women love that jacket it's pink it's yellow it's colorful it's
21:31
awesome you guys seen that one that [ __ ] gets attention right Big Shiny colors big beard you know they don't know
21:37
[ __ ] watches okay guys know because they think they get laid from it if I got that watch I'd get laid I know it
21:42
didn't work yet but at least I got to [ __ ] this Ginger guy I mean uh do business so okay so just being idiot so
21:52
I don't even know saying at this point so okay so B so basically um I always feel like I learned this from South Park South Park said like whatever would just
21:58
be funny just say it you ever you know Matt Parker and Trey Stone they did South Park they said like because they try to give a holistic message in South
22:04
Park but they said that while they try to give a holistic message if it's funny [ __ ] the holistic message just say it so that's like what I do it's like if I got
22:10
to talk about me having gay sex with another rich guy if it's funny [ __ ] the message I'm just gonna say that that's literally how I think anyway
22:18
so why is that so funny so um percee value is everything okay so why did that
22:25
person whether it's the person that you're friends with the person that you work with um the person who you're romantically involved with why they
22:30
start to disrespect you they disrespect you because you're too available you're too common and so you have to understand
22:37
what does it mean to make yourself vulnerable to another person you should try to understand what that means okay a
22:42
woman what make in my I'm getting my opinion every woman I can't tell a woman how she thinks that's her prerogative I
22:48
say how I think so I just one man's opinion subjective but my subjective opinion is that a woman makes vulnerable
22:54
by giving away her prime years to a man so in other words if that girl was 22 she met a guy and she was having sex
23:00
with him for 3 years they break up she didn't get a ring out of it that was years in her prime that higher level men
23:06
would have married her and she gave that away to you so even by being with you at all sleeping with you being with you
23:12
being your girlfriend just by virtue of the time of her fertile years that she's giving you that is making herself
23:17
vulnerable okay for a man where we make ourselves vulnerable is that we clear
23:23
our roster for the woman so in other words as a man let's say for example Le
23:29
that you're dating five women 10 women 20 women 30 women and let's say that you've got great friends and you have
23:36
hobbies and passions and you have your business all these different things that you're doing that give you [ __ ] Joy
23:43
okay now when you're unexclusive how much incredible treatment do you get
23:48
when you're not willing to be exclusive how do you get treated when you're not exclusive come on guys how do you get treated we're not exclusive how what
23:54
kind of treatment do you get I mean come on come on guys how do you get treated when you're when you're when you say no
24:00
I will not I will not be exclusive with you how do you get treated amazing ridiculous okay like where do I like
24:08
guys look like this is like my phone all day like this is mean but
24:16
Anonymous um like I don't know where where to start
24:22
uh how are you uh I'm about to get engaged but I
24:28
can't survive without seeing you I don't know what to do the other day I explained that to him poor guy the other
24:33
day I explained that to him in a little a little but of course he doesn't understand of course he won't be okay with it as in coming out of sex with me
24:38
um I can't live without you I wish I could see you uh I enjoy your holiday I love
24:45
you then I just wrote uh just come see me when I'm back from Chicago okay so that's like that's how you get treated
24:51
when you're not exclusive that guy who's exclusive is getting that treatment do you understand okay so that's that's the
24:58
kind of treatment um you know that's that is what you
25:04
get damn I'll kidnap you
25:10
anytime but no I'm sure here [ __ ] rocking it down there just doing it up
25:17
so good and you know it was so fun was being down there with you okay so like
25:24
that's called not exclusive okay and and and she won't care she wouldn't care she's my friend so she wouldn't care
25:30
okay she she would laugh so the point is like that's the treatment without exclusivity okay non-exclusive treated
25:38
like a king okay and the reason why that is is because you become the AP you become the Rolex you become the PCH
25:44
right um you get treated amazing like if you have to understand one guy takes his
25:50
time and he uh invests into his significant other buys her flowers you
25:56
know takes her out BL blah BL BL okay how does he get treated now other guy
26:03
okay take that same energy meet people out be social build networks build a
26:09
party do the best part I I run the best party in La frequently okay best party in La everybody wants to go you're
26:16
getting blown up you go to the party you're the host of the party you just you walk through you just walk through
26:22
you're being grabbed at being pulled around being asked for attention being treated well there's no argu it's it's
26:29
less work than being with one person it's less work you all you did was go out socialize a little bit put on a
26:36
little party and everybody treats you great but here's the problem with that can you get a family out of that well an
26:43
intentional family not an accidental family can you get can you get what I I got three kids from a previous relationship what do you think is more
26:49
what do you think is better me going to the party being like getting text like this or my children the text
26:58
I just that's my inner South Park okay so no the no obviously my kids okay
27:03
anyway goodbye little kids okay Daddy's got work to do okay so no obviously your
27:10
kids right so yeah your you know your family's far more important right so obviously there's um you know it's nice
27:16
to have a partner you don't have to use a condom you can have a family you don't have to pull out if you want to have
27:21
family um you know you have intimacy you can build it up but that just like how
27:27
if a woman is going to give you you know a period of her youth to you that better
27:32
result in some kind of a commitment or family or something otherwise she's burning down those a lot of women feel differently about that I'm just giving my take and that's fine um I'm right but
27:40
we'll pretend that I'm not yes I'm that's Different Strokes for different folks losing your Prime to a [ __ ] boy is
27:47
smart Okay so okay so um what I'm saying
27:53
is like it's um she's making herself vulnerable to you by giving you that so
27:58
in a perfect world you would be appreciative of that and you build a family with her if that was something
28:04
you thought made sense and it does if it does make sense you know you try it out and try to get on the same page and it makes sense well likewise hopefully
28:10
you'd meet somebody where they value the fact that you cleared your roster for them you stopped you can still do like a
28:16
taco Tuesday you can have a little bit of fun actually would recommend that you do I'll talk about that in the speech but you know you're not doing the same
28:22
ragers you're not doing the same like level of networking you're giving that up you know like that girl the message
28:28
that I played there that's my friend right people say oh you get rid of your hoes she's not a hoe guys she's my
28:33
[ __ ] friend so if I'm going to be in a relationship I've got to call her and I go hey babe look you know I'm getting
28:38
into a relationship I've got to go I've got to deal with her tears she's my real friend it's probably not appropriate for me to keep seeing her maybe we could
28:44
establish a friendship where the girl that I'm with is like cool with that but you know it's probably not the best so
28:51
you give that up right so you're making yourself vulnerable by giving up going out doing parties the attention etc etc
28:58
etc you're giving away options you're giving away that night out in Vegas with your boys laughing having fun meeting
29:05
new people out in South Beach winding your hair in my case wind in my beard
29:10
having fun partying with your friends you should never give that freedom up so easily so many guys are so hurried to
29:18
give away that freedom without enjoying it you've got the rest of your life to be getting chewed out by some old bag and yet guys are so pathetically
29:24
desperate not to be single it's pathetic um you will be in decades in that relationship with your kids there's not
29:30
a rush so make sure that you play it properly but you have to know how to play that properly so um the woman makes
29:37
herself very vulnerable the man makes himself vulnerable so if I have a daughter what would I tell my daughter I'm going to be honest with you guys I
29:43
I'm GNA say some [ __ ] up [ __ ] right now I tell my daughter don't [ __ ] him ever I would never say that's not me
29:49
being uh [ __ ] shaming at all I'm talking pure market economics here what the [ __ ]
29:56
has that guy done for you and than wait waste your [ __ ] time I have wasted so
30:01
much time okay like when I look at the sheer volume of time that I've wasted um
30:07
think about that right what did that [ __ ] do for you at the end of the day think about that right what what
30:13
level of man can a woman get in her prime what level of man sky is the limit
30:19
sky is the [ __ ] limit I mean men will what would you
30:25
guys do to get with that girl who you like that much you would go to the women don't understand this right they're like
30:31
he's not calling me yet but maybe he likes me women he doesn't like you but like literally a guy who likes a woman
30:37
will go to the end of the Earth okay the end of the [ __ ] Earth if you really
30:44
into that woman right but they'll choose a guy who's who's not feeling them like that right and who's not going to
30:50
propose and who's not going to put the ring on it etc etc they waste their [ __ ] time what are you doing with some dude oh he's my boyfriend who he
30:56
gave me he's we're like a exclusive couple who gives a [ __ ] he's burning down your time okay it is a this is
31:03
harsh but true that is a tangible multi-million doll asset that is being
31:09
vandalized by this [ __ ] [ __ ] okay so this is not about [ __ ] shaming this is about market economics that's why if I
31:14
was a woman some guy's trying to [ __ ] me get the [ __ ] out of here [ __ ] off that's what I'd say I'd say [ __ ] you [ __ ] off
31:22
because that's like if I have a business and you guys are just come trying to Jack me that's all it is it's just trying to Jack that's that's it it's
31:28
it's lowering her value wasting her time there's no value in it at all so that's
31:35
what I do if I was a woman um and I would make myself vulnerable for a guy who I think is legit and who I think is
31:41
serious and guys are liars guys are [ __ ] Liars you guys all will burn down a girl's time not commit have fun
31:48
and just bounce you know that you will and I will too you want to know that it's
31:54
awesome it's great you know because I've dat a lot of amazing women in my life
32:00
and I'm 44 and I look at him now I'm like geez thank God I got the [ __ ] out of there right I'm not I don't I got to
32:05
pay the bill I ate the food I did a I did a d and dash I got the [ __ ] out of there I had the iPhone iPhone 7 turn in
32:12
I got the iPhone 8 got the nine Oh look The 10 11 iPhone 12 wow 13 14 iPhone the
32:19
15 iPhone these iPhones just keep coming right so I understand that as a as a woman they make themselves vulnerable to
32:26
men that don't commit it's just the [ __ ] truth no I'm free I'm liberated I'm empowered yeah you're empowered you're empowered to have to work out
32:32
okay okay so you're man you don't have a wonderful wonderful man who [ __ ] loves you to love and cherish you
32:37
instead you work for your boss good for you you work for some Corporation [ __ ] boss so you're always working
32:43
for somebody right but as a man so that's a woman making herself vulnerable right and you and I think it's worth it to appreciate that but as a man you make
32:50
yourself vulnerable by clearing your roster not doing parties not crushing it and so on and so forth okay so you have
32:57
to understand that like if you're seeing somebody and you're trying to be a good man and you're trying in good faith to
33:03
get that to a place where there could be a family built out of it but she is not willing she takes that vulnerability as
33:08
what what do a lot of women take your niess as that vulnerability how do they take it weakness oh he needs me because
33:14
what you just love her to death you love her so much you would give her anything You' give her your [ __ ] soul and you do sometimes it gets taken his weakness
33:21
likewise a lot of men women's dating him and he goes I got her whatever right
33:26
same thing so you have to understand where your value is look that's just my take that's my hot take feel free to
33:32
disagree I think I'm right but I'd recommend that you should make your own opinion okay a lot of different opinions out there I'm just giving mine I want to
33:37
just be honest with what I think think whatever you want okay but understand
33:42
like um if you're in a relationship with somebody and they're not playing Fair
33:49
like wait a minute I cut off my roster I cut off my parties I cut all the [ __ ] out and then you're going to dog me out
33:56
be super mean distract during work and what they'll do is they'll turn you into someone who they don't like that's the
34:02
key piece they'll they'll turn you into a version of yourself that they're no longer into it's crazy right it's like I love
34:10
you so much that I listen to you and then you [ __ ] hate me okay they'll encourage you not to go to the gym not
34:17
to [ __ ] build your business not to keep having fun to they'll [ __ ] you out and then they'll then they'll call you
34:22
insensitive unloving it with a closed heart just because you don't want to listen to [ __ ] all day while you're on a [ __ ] $10,000 vacation and that will
34:29
actually happen and then you won't re you by the end of that relationship you won't recognize yourself anymore you
34:34
will become a version of yourself that is so distan from who you were at the start of that relationship you will not
34:40
recognize yourself how many of you in have had it where you tried so hard to make relationship work and by the end of it you didn't even recognize that
34:45
version of yourself anymore put your hand way up if that happened to you yeah crazy it's crazy how it happens right and like you're you're just gutted out
34:52
and by the end of it they no longer respect you and you're just begging them back because literally like all those
34:58
little things that you did that you loved you give them up you just gra you get you gradually baby step yourself
35:04
almost like painting yourself into this little corner and then now you're just stuck in this little corner with like no more real estate left right and like my
35:11
my buddy Mike right he had a relationship and this girl left him divorce him and I remember um when he
35:16
met her he lived in uh Brooklyn and or in uh man Manhattan with Brooklyn off to the side right and they
35:22
would do some of the best parties in New York he had five girlfriends um you know he had and he had like the coolest
35:27
parties like it wasn't just um you know like some like little drugged out cocaine party like a lot these stupid ass parties right it was like people
35:34
doing yoga people doing different dance styles all different like things like awesome awesome awesome he ran the whole
35:39
damn thing right so he's got all that clout crazy right and he finally met his wife and he loved her so much and um
35:47
what happened was you know first he's got like the cool car and he's got you know he's living in the cool place and
35:52
he's fun right and he's charismatic couple years later he's living in the suburbs
35:58
he's got the [ __ ] minivan he's out of shape doesn't have current clothes he's no longer
36:04
charismatic he doesn't have all his old friends he no longer does parties now she on the other hand didn't
36:11
work and she had something called an equinox pass and that was enough that's enough
36:18
CU she was slim and had that fat ass and that's all it takes sometimes right So
36:24
eventually she left him and she went with the crypto millionaire okay so now
36:29
she's on the big fat yacht the yacht with the crypto
36:36
millionaire okay and it took her a grand total of five hours to get her [ __ ]
36:44
together to have no interruption in service you know what I'm saying by that
36:50
it's like an internet provider you know oh uh Time Warner crapped out go to
36:55
Spectrum continuation service no shift in lifesty my
37:03
buddy oh whoa whoa whoa okay this is a
37:09
job okay this took the best coach in the world an hour a day on the phone for
37:15
like a [ __ ] almost a year to to get this guy back going okay that would be if I had charged him for that that would have been like millions of dollars in
37:22
[ __ ] coaching but I did this cuz he is one of the most important people in the [ __ ] country and you guys would be [ __ ] if this guy didn't exist so I
37:28
did that for him for you and for me okay cuz that guy's not going down by the way she didn't give a [ __ ] if this country
37:34
imploded if that guy got [ __ ] up okay CU he want to be on the boat so okay so
37:41
so what did he have to do he's now got to get back in shape do I need to be in
37:47
shape to have social skills no as many of you will find out tonight but the point being is most people do okay
37:52
because they don't have the level of social skills um he had to I mean let's look at let's how box in he is here he
37:58
owns a home not in South Beach but [ __ ] an hour away you can't even go
38:04
out you're trapped you're trapped you know why look at how vulnerable he made
38:10
himself why is he trapped why did he get that house because you're living you're living in South Beach or Brickle or
38:15
whatever in the nice area you're paying 12,000 a month for like a [ __ ] [ __ ] two-bedroom you know the wifey
38:21
comes to she goes baby we're married I love you why don't you why don't we get a big giant house 45 minutes away no big
38:27
deal right he goes he gets a house etc etc etc right you know baby why do you
38:32
need this like you know sports car we got kids coming get the van it's cheaper it can fit the kids baby why are you
38:39
going to the gym all the time I'll go to the gym I'll be cute for you just stay home and work for the kids right well by
38:44
the end of it he's a version she no longer wants okay so he made himself vulnerable and then what happened was
38:50
once he listened she became difficult annoying frustrating and so on and so
38:56
forth but he was not in either okay and so he also had made mistakes because a
39:01
he listened to that was dumb and he knows that now but B he also never took her out he wasn't funny anymore so even
39:07
though he's listening to her he should have known a little bit better so it's Al it's it's really both you know it takes two to tango guys so it's really
39:12
both sides fault okay but that's what happens when you make yourself vulnerable look in truth do you want
39:17
know what happened to her after they broke up it actually turned out uh she had a some kind of I think it was called an ovarian cyst and she's infertile so
39:23
she actually wasted her fertile window on my buddy so both got screwed okay although she is on a boat so she'll be
39:29
screwed on a boat but she won't have kids or her family he's lucky he got out of there he would have spent his whole
39:35
life going you know what I know we never had our own kids but I love you so much not even realizing that it wasn't even
39:41
like legit okay funny St works that's called making yourself vulnerable look I've had it okay this is the thing that
39:46
I used to have okay so back when I had all the coaches back in the day I thought that it was more economical to
39:52
set up the back end of the business to where we would have shared resources cuz you could do it for cheaper
39:57
that allowed us to have a competitive Advantage cuz I would have 10 coaches and you'd set up the back end where dependent on their revenue um you could
40:04
support a back end that was cheaper and larger and more powerful and more effective so we would have that right but they knew that and sometimes those
40:11
coaches would come to me and say you're going to pay me this you're going to pay me that you're going to pay me the other thing putting myself in debt like literally I would just be in debt if I
40:17
say yes to that but they knew that I built that infrastructure and I am a nice guy I'm a bleeding heart sometimes
40:23
and I don't want to see our people lose their jobs and I literally watch coaches say to me if you don't give me what I want you will cost this person by name
40:30
their job this person their job this person their job this person their job and they would put that on me ruthless
40:36
and these were men who did this so guys will do that yes your favorite little coach is a lot more nasty than you think
40:42
so okay so they okay just like your favorite girl can be and just like guys can be so it's the same [ __ ] right it's like that guy who keeps [ __ ] the girl
40:49
going I'll I'll get you the ring later I'll get you the ring later and he never gets it waste her [ __ ] time now she's 38 years old frantically running around
40:56
looking for a guy to get her pregnant okay frantically and many of many of my exes who never wound up getting married
41:02
I try to coach and help them to get married some of these girls are Perfect 10s lovely total sweethearts but they do
41:07
date [ __ ] boys and now they hit 39 and they go [ __ ] no one impregnated me yet no one married me yet and now they have
41:13
to do is they they have to be on a date not even sure if they even can get pregnant and they have to be on a date and they're like look are you serious or
41:19
not because I I literally cannot even waste a month with you like I can't even give you a month how much then that lowers their market value imagine that
41:26
you're a guy you meet a girl she's gorgeous but she's got like a month left to get pregnant and she's like unless you're going to impregnate impregnate me
41:31
in a month I I can't do this right it kind of freaks you out to be fair mostly in this room if you're kind of chish
41:37
you'd probably take it but you know but the guys that she wants would not and so
41:42
you know what of my lovely exes is in that situation right now she's a seven time Playboy Playmate and lovely girl
41:48
and she's awesome and you know hottest [ __ ] on the Block and uh she dated a lot of guys like me that are kind of fun
41:53
but weren't serious for her um I wasn't serious for her because she also kind of liked to flip out and I can't get involved on that I can't be a co-parent
42:00
with somebody who flips out but you know so it kind of goes both ways but the point is yeah she had her time burned down and wound up screwed I didn't do it
42:05
on purpose and I got out of there when she was a lot younger um but anyway that's called making yourself vulnerable
42:11
right so you have to understand okay if that's making me vulnerable where is the line and here's how you have to think
42:17
about it where is the line where I'm becoming and listen to me closely I am
42:23
becoming a version of myself that this person would no longer respect so taking
42:29
the case with coaches I made myself financially vulnerable to try to help like like my buddy Mike who moved to the suburbs why
42:36
did he move to the suburbs it wasn't it wasn't for no reason there was a reason what's the reason he went there because
42:42
it was cheaper for to build a family it was not with negative intention it was done with positive intention but for the wrong person okay if I build a shared
42:49
infrastructure that's more economical and works better for coaches but then you know rather than rather than them
42:55
saying wow this is really cool I want to be part of this they go they each of them go you're going to give me this you're going to give me that cuz I know that you're
43:01
[ __ ] well that's the wrong person I made myself vulnerable to the wrong person so you had to be aware of that
43:08
now in the past what I would do when I'm younger and I think every almost everybody does this maybe some don't but most do is Double Down triple down hey
43:14
come on you're my boy I love you and all this [ __ ] and you try to fix it you try to fix it try to fix it try to fix it
43:20
try to fix it by the end of this you no longer recognize yourself you do not
43:26
know who you are anymore more okay there's been women in my life where I love them so much I just want to fix it and I can't and no matter what I did I
43:33
couldn't fix it but what happened is once that little seesaw breaks and they feel that you are trying to fix it they
43:40
get a power trip they start getting a dopamine rush out of it like a Coke adct they start power tripping for people who are not used to that kind of power it's
43:47
new to them and it's like a [ __ ] demon jumps in them and you see a very [ __ ] up version of them okay any of you ever done that with like maybe X's
43:53
where like you it's it started so good you're like man this used to be so we really loved each other this was so good like what the hell happened this is
44:00
crazy and you guys ever been through that you see someone power tripping like you know you see a version of them that
44:05
you never knew and then you see a version of yourself that you never knew and you're like damn like who the [ __ ] is this who the [ __ ] has this person
44:11
turned into who the hell did I commit to and who the hell am I and if you have
44:16
cut off your options for too long and you're not aware of how to handle that but winds up happening is you'll you'll
44:23
gradually shift your behavior your behavior shifts your behavior shifts your behavior shifts your behavior shifts and you will behave in ways where
44:30
you don't recognize yourself like I had that with coaches where I just so badly didn't want to see our culture get [ __ ] up
44:35
that I would be like look uh I'll cut you a better deal better deal better deal better deal you would see it to the point where it's like here set a 5050
44:44
you take 60 take 70 take 80 take 90 look just keep all the money just don't go
44:51
[ __ ] up our culture in the public and just go your own way by the end of that you think think they stop at
44:58
100 no they go you're going to just pay me extra money cuz I I think that you get a bit of traffic from me so you're
45:03
going to send me money or I'm going to go public it's it's there's a trajectory to it where it never [ __ ] ends and
45:10
you'll see that in divorces where people get fleeced they gave everything and then they go I'm going to take you to court I'm going to weaponize the the
45:15
judicial system against you take you to court I'm going to [ __ ] you in the ass in ways that you can't even understand you're going to pay me for decades and that kind of [ __ ] and then they get in
45:21
there and they're like they're like vitriolic they're evil you know and it's scary so that's the kind of [ __ ] that can happen if you're not [ __ ] careful
45:27
you got to be very you got to be careful who the [ __ ] you get involved with and you got to be careful who the [ __ ] you are as a person or you will get screwed
45:34
in ways that you can't understand life has pitfalls you get involved with the wrong people you will get [ __ ] in ways
45:39
that you can't even begin to understand you will spend years trying to refix yourself to you know to to fix yourself and come back out of it ironically a lot
45:45
of time the same person that was super mean to you will say that you were the [ __ ] and then you're like I had G I
45:51
sold you and they think you're the [ __ ] [ __ ] the whole thing is [ __ ] because projection you can look that up so it's [ __ ] crazy what
45:58
happens um so what I would say to you guys is again bronze plan silver plan go
46:07
plan plan and in effect you know the protocol if the person is if the person
46:13
is a say the word after me even though it's a bit of a weird word say repository of value say that okay so in
46:20
other words if that person is someone that you can be nice to and you can make yourself vulnerable to you can make you
46:25
can weaken yourself to be synergistic with them so the two of you are stronger together if they're the kind of person
46:31
who are like look the fact that you did that for me the fact that you married me
46:37
or the fact that you had sex with me or the fact that you partnered up with me in business the fact that you are employed by me the fact that you um you
46:44
know could have built your own business but you choose to work for me or you know anything like that if someone sees
46:51
that and they're like you know what when you do that for me I'll do 100x for you
46:56
if if you're someone like that if you're with somebody like that you can go to the Moon to with them you can go to the
47:01
Galaxy with them you go to the [ __ ] stars it's awesome human beings are better together we can do amazing things but if you detected that person is
47:07
somebody who's kind of in their ego and lower forms of Consciousness and they begin to interpret that Synergy as
47:13
weakness and then they begin to exploit it and they begin to have what's called RIS flips like rationalize all this
47:18
crazy [ __ ] which happens a lot then you've got to recognize that and you've got to know how you pull back okay so in
47:23
other words um in my own case did you guys notice how I
47:29
didn't build any new instructors in recent years in my own company I said to myself I want at least five or 10 year I
47:35
love building out instructors every instructor I've ever built out built a million-dollar brand a huge amounts of
47:41
success in here's the funny part in other people's Brands I built them out
47:46
and that was a lot cleaner than when I went in business with them that was the harder part okay so it was cleaner when
47:52
we just did it on a pay per coaching thing but when I went in full business that's where it usually got messy and I
47:58
was like I'm not doing I'm not doing that again for a long time until I have really really centered myself in my in
48:05
the own trajectory of my own brand because I like to build other people I I would prefer to build you than to just
48:11
build myself I enjoy working with other people it gives me joy and happiness to see other people grow it's why I like teaching so that's why do you guys see
48:17
how many people I built up it's crazy but I decided I've got to pull back a little bit now what I should have done
48:24
let me give you some examples okay like to watch what should I have done back in the day with instructors here was what I
48:30
should have done I should have brought in my friends Aaron dowy Ty Lopez BR and
48:35
Carter Graham stefen so many different guys that I've hung out with over the years and I should have been bringing
48:41
them in at things like the world Summit and then if I had guys that I built up from scratch as instructors who don't have their own Brands I could have said
48:48
if you get to this target then you get stage time but instead what I would do is I would take random non-name guys I'd
48:54
throw them on stage and you know what they would often say they'd say well I'm doing your work for
49:00
you do I need anybody to run the stage for me guys would I rather give the stage time
49:06
away to someone else or do I want it but the the the script gets flipped I did your work all that having another
49:12
instructor does is gives you another offering to maybe do some sales but that's it you don't need it at all I did
49:18
it because I like the family component why do you get a significant other you don't need a significant other you do it for love you do it for family right but
49:25
sometimes like it's you know like I've been in relationships where like you know I went in that relationship running some of the best parties in La you know
49:33
awesome awesome dating life super awesome Epic roster I didn't need to be in that relationship but I went in it
49:38
because I love the person I genuinely love them but what happened was they took that as weakness as if like I was taking
49:45
something as if I needed something from them and they began to believe that and they took that as weakness and by the
49:52
time and then by the time that you take that as weakness I even found myself saying dumb [ __ ] like this babe what the
49:57
[ __ ] are you talking about you saw the parties I used to run you knew who I was seeing before you why are you acting
50:03
like this I don't need anything from you I really do love you do you think that helps what does that
50:08
do yeah so so now this person who you love is is saying oh they're throwing
50:14
all this endless [ __ ] at you but how were they acting back when you were when
50:20
you had uh when you were non- exclusive how did they act love what was that little audio I
50:25
just played for you that audio that I showed you that would be absolutely average that is that's not like
50:32
exceptional she's amazing I love you baby but okay she's awesome but that is completely normal that's
50:39
absolutely standard behavior when you're not exclusive why it's like the watch
50:45
it's the watch that you can't get you are the watch that they can't get so you
50:51
have to have a protocol where once you realize that that's not you want to try to resolve but if it cannot be resolved
50:56
solved rapidly shift protocols rapidly rebuild your value rapidly put that
51:02
price tag back on yourself okay so I would not I would honestly not um take
51:08
on new instructors until because you guys remember I nuked my YouTube channel then I just want traveling for half a
51:13
decade you guys oops right it was actually a lot of fun I don't I'm kind of retired I don't have to do it once
51:19
I've rebuilt my channel to I don't know a certain level maybe I would think about bringing on somebody else but I
51:25
would never do a joint back end ever again I would never do a joint back end because it just antagonizes the worst
51:32
behavior out of people you've ever [ __ ] seen I hate to say it I don't mean to be negative but I watch this Behavior consistent across human beings
51:38
these are good guys they're all actually all great guys I I love them all but I saw that behavior I've seen similar
51:43
behavior in marriages and relationships where the guy gives up not just his roster but his Hobbies his friends and
51:50
the things that make him who he is so you've got to start to realize is this thing that I'm giving up making it where
51:55
this person can no longer respect me right I believe that I'm helping them I think that is good but they can no
52:02
longer value me or respect me based on what it is that I'm doing and then you've got to know how to modify and
52:07
adapt okay so here's something you're going to do I want to Envision that you take all that
52:14
love all that love okay that you have for that person whether it's in business friendship networking or romantic we
52:20
talk here a lot about romantic love okay and imagine if instead of I want you to do an audit of those exact hours that
52:26
you're spending trying to resolve a relationship when a relationship is not working how many hours a day are you spending trying to make it work on
52:31
average be real come on guys be reals yeah you know you got to spend quality time with the person
52:38
right yeah you give it everything you're trying to fix it you're like trying to be there for the person right trying to put in that time I remember one time it
52:45
was during covid on the tail end of Co and the business was a lot harder at that point because we because we couldn't do the things that we used to
52:50
be able to do and I had a partner at that time and you know I saw um they
52:56
were perpetually mad at me which distracted me distracted me from work work wasn't getting done we were going
53:01
below payroll getting below payroll below payroll below payroll debts racking up debts racking up she's
53:06
getting more mat Matt look I love this I'm not trying to hate but it's just what the truth right she'd have her own side of it you never know the full side
53:12
of the story till you heard both sides but the point is so you'd have to hear both sides but you know the bottom line is down down down down down and I'm
53:17
sitting there just trying to fix it while I'm watching as we're going further in debt but she's in a bad mood I don't want to lose a relationship so
53:24
I'm trying to put in quality time with her down down down down down she
53:30
left now I've got to deal with a breakup and being bankrupt at the same time do you know what you feel like when
53:37
you're broken up with with someone that you love that much and you're
53:42
bankrupt what do you want to
53:48
do you want to die I was about to have to move out of my home fire my staff all all W how how
53:57
how much bandwidth are you at when you lose a major relationship how much bandwidth are you at what would you guys
54:04
guess you barely function because you're so sad I'm sitting there so sad about
54:09
the breakup while watching my business fall apart my business is on fire but
54:14
I'm just sad about the breakup and what I realized from that is I'm like man there's probably guys out there that kill themselves for real there's
54:20
probably men out there that [ __ ] kill themselves over this [ __ ] cuz I felt like it to be honest with you cuz it's just complete dopamine cra complete
54:27
failure and it was actually I think like kind of almost a Divine moment for that
54:32
to happen and look I I'll always love her I'm not I don't hold that against her I I'll take my side of that you know it takes to to tango so I spent a lot of
54:38
time reflecting and thinking what I could have done better and uh she added a lot to my life you know it's it's sometimes things don't end well but
54:44
doesn't mean they weren't awesome when you're in it she'll always be like lot of ways that Sil is my best friend I love her that much but didn't end the
54:50
best you know right sub's life is like really good and then it ends with like a heart attack or something you know doesn't mean your life was bad but
54:55
didn't end the best that was a great relationship but didn't end the best it just kind it was really good for a long time and then and just
55:00
went down I tried to fix I couldn't um so the thing is
55:07
uh I felt like it was a powerful experience because I realized there's a lot of guys that deal with this and women that have their own version of it
55:13
too so the Epiphany that I had was be aware of where your boundaries are and
55:19
be aware when something is no longer resolvable I've never seen a situ here's the main a big takeaway for all of you
55:26
okay big nugget I've never seen a relationship get fixed once it's on the downward trajectory like that I've just
55:32
never seen it I've never actually seen the [ __ ] thing get fixed so pretty much what I what I've seen is once
55:39
you're kind of just overinvestment
55:56
okay so in most of those situations if I could do them over if I had to do over what I would do is I would have admitted
56:02
to myself when it was not going to be fixed and I would have got out sooner I had relationships with different people that I work with where I was trying to
56:09
fix it for like one or two or three years frantically just trying to fix it so hard and winds up in the most ugly
56:16
endings and it couldn't it was never going to be fixed and the reason why was because these were people that were fans
56:21
of mine when they came in they they love me they pedestalize me like with the girls right they start off with pedal so
56:28
this is not a thing that women do men do it too it's when people lose respect
56:33
when they came in the situation when you were in abundance when you had when you were someone to be chased they treat you
56:39
one way and then you lose that power they treat you another way so you've got to understand that protocol so here's what you got to do okay do an audit of
56:47
how much time you're putting into that relationship if the relationship is getting to the point that you're putting
56:53
more time into it that you could spend building a very vigorously fun single life switch gears and take all that love
57:01
withdraw it although leave them in peace and wish them the best and put it back in that because here's what you guys
57:06
don't realize for most of you that have been in these situations this includes myself you forget how much power you
57:12
actually have and you forget how baller you can actually be okay if you guys were to look at my life right now I
57:18
happen to still be single right now I'll be in a relationship at some point but if you guys are look at my life right now and seeing the parties that I'm doing and the fun that I'm having you'd
57:25
be surprised that I was ever even in a relationship at all and you'd be surprised that I can even summon the
57:30
focus even think about this if you saw what it looked like now you go you're crazy why would you why would you even
57:36
get in a relationship you're having too much fun you're living the dream bro well you know again you get in a relationship to build a family so
57:41
there's reasons why you do it there's a lot of value in relations but it's not
57:47
value to the point that you should lose who you are over that damn relationship okay so what you do the protocol is as
57:53
soon as you realize you're burning too much time on this withdraw admit when it's done get out and then
57:59
what you do is you start going out every day go out every day why why do you go out every day because you were already
58:05
putting six hours a day in the damn relationship right that six you could go
58:10
out two hours a day and get more Val get more Roi more return on investment on that two hours then on the six hours of
58:17
trying to fix somebody with someone who no longer respects you they don't respect you they're not going to respect you it's not going to change they're not
58:23
going to respect you it is no different that again this watch say it was 100K at one point the value
58:29
goes down to $5 and they're going can I still have the 100K come on and they're going it's five
58:35
bucks it's a $5 watch why' I give you 100K it's a $5 watch right it's kind of like in a relationship well at one point
58:41
you pedestalize me at one point you love me at one point you're into me yeah but you're not worth that anymore you've
58:47
allowed me to chip away at the dynamic to the point that you've proven that you're [ __ ] worthless you have
58:52
chipped away you have allowed me to get you to give up your to give up what was good about you to
58:58
give away any kind of internal power that you had to make yourself completely vulnerable to me you no longer are
59:04
someone I need I no longer find validation in your approval I no longer
59:09
find it exciting to be with you I now realize that you will tolerate any complaining and whining and [ __ ] I
59:16
can throw any amount of threats at you and you'll [ __ ] cave you will you you will never walk you will let me walk all
59:23
over you there is no limit there is no bronze silver gold or platinum plan
59:29
there's just the Platinum plan for everyone right everyone gets a Rox
59:34
everyone gets a pek everyone gets an AP everyone gets a Lambo everyone gets a mansion well now it's worthless okay so
59:42
you've allowed that behavior too long worthless so what happens you start going out usually what happens when you
59:48
start going back out again is you're crushed you're sad you miss your girl you you know you you you lose a a team
59:54
member you're sad you you you had had a vision for that business relationship you lose a friend you had a vision for that you're sad you're [ __ ] up man
1:00:00
you're [ __ ] up you're [ __ ] up you know yeah you go out you just want your
1:00:07
partner back you want them to love you how they used to love you you want to see that smile you you look at these old
1:00:13
videos of you and them with them entranced with you loving you and why
1:00:18
why can't we go back to that I back then when you did that I wasn't even exclusive with you now I'm exclusive
1:00:25
with you and you're like this right well what do you said that if
1:00:30
I would just be nicer that you'd finally be nice like what do you need right what
1:00:36
is the definition of of of addiction the definition of addiction is that all instead of getting fulfillment from all
1:00:41
these things you just get it from one thing crack cocaine heroin drugs whatever gambling whatever that's
1:00:47
addiction so what happens if you're with one person you made yourself vulnerable that could be a good thing but it can
1:00:52
also be an addiction it can also be destructive and then to get that next hit you'll [ __ ] yourself up right
1:01:01
likewise you will [ __ ] yourself up to try to get back in with that person that you lost so it's completely [ __ ]
1:01:07
toxic and basically what happens is that you you become this quivering whining
1:01:14
pathetic begging [ __ ] that you don't recognize like
1:01:19
wanting a hit but it's even more confusing because we know that drugs are bad drugs are bad
1:01:26
okay but if it's somebody who you love it's like no I'm
1:01:33
doing this out of love I'm trying to fix this out of love I love this person I don't want to just throw them away and
1:01:39
be this La person in my case right I don't want to be this La person who just walks so it's confusing as [ __ ] okay but
1:01:48
the bottom line is you've lost the respect it's it's over you got to just admit it it's done it's not going to get fixed so I've never regretted any
1:01:54
business relationship or friendship romantic relationship for that first 80% but it's always that last 20 30% when
1:02:01
the respect is lost because you made yourself vulnerable and they took that as weakness that is where it goes so
1:02:08
[ __ ] toxic that the only thing that you got out of is a lesson you got a great lesson out of it it showed you real good what happens when you give
1:02:14
your yourself away okay um who here has been in this situation put your hands way up if if this has been you at some
1:02:20
point but you're had way up okay ARR you guys never had a significant other but
1:02:26
what happened when your hand cream bottle got mad at you same [ __ ] okay your hand cream ran out so okay I know I
1:02:35
I've had a lot of strong conversations with my hand cream bottle when it runs out sometimes you know why I don't want
1:02:41
that dry chafing so you start going out and you're going to feel here's what you're going to feel you're going to
1:02:47
feel this kind of weird estrogen feeling in your body if you're guy okay and you're like I just want to love and then
1:02:52
and then you and then you go out here's what happens you go out and you see all these different people that that you'd
1:02:57
meet and you go I wouldn't make a single one of these into relationship okay now here's what you've forgotten first of all if you help to elevate that person
1:03:05
they were not that person when you met them as well you might perhaps you help to elevate them and in addition you
1:03:11
built Synergy and teamwork with them well of course nobody's going to be at that level you haven't put it in the
1:03:17
time right the Rel the value of the relationship is about is about the time that you put into the relationship you put the time
1:03:23
in um so that's part of what you're going to feel you're going to say there's no one out here worth it and then you're going to say I don't want
1:03:29
casual relationships I don't want a roster I want um someone special here's
1:03:35
what you guys don't understand okay now this is g to get real this is getting real deep okay so pay close attention
1:03:41
Okay pay close attention here's what you got to understand um you will
1:03:47
see that you will not be able to get a significant other you will not until you
1:03:52
don't want one because what happens is you are not the hard to get watch you
1:03:59
are the watch that is begging to be picked you're the Pick Me person okay so in your brain here's what you're saying
1:04:05
I don't want to have to go out on a Friday night I don't want to have to live downtown I don't want to have to
1:04:12
live in a high volume area where the rent's a bit more expensive I don't want to have to do a party I don't want to have to
1:04:18
socialize you're not in the spirit of it you hate it but in reality what is it you really
1:04:23
hate I mean what did you have before a significant other that disrespected you and couldn't have f with you but you
1:04:30
just want that back cuz you're like addicted to abuse it's not abuse but it's like not fun you know abuse
1:04:36
metaphorically so what do you what are you losing what do you even lost you didn't your life
1:04:42
actually is getting better but you're not admitting that to yourself now the next thing that happens is you go out and your voice gets sore man my voice
1:04:49
gets sore going out and socializing people this is tough right and that's actually real also man I'm up so late how do you do this I'm not young anymore
1:04:55
more I'm too I'm too old for this I can't do this you know you're like 38 or something I can't do it it's too late
1:05:02
for me I'll never meet anyone look guys I'm 44 it's never been easier but
1:05:07
understand like socializing has never been easier it gets easier every year but you won't realize that the time
1:05:14
because you're out of practice so you're going to get tired from it it's going to bleed out your bank not living in the
1:05:20
[ __ ] [ __ ] suburbs maybe you've got you know my buddy he had a mortgage he has to sell his [ __ ]
1:05:26
house okay selling your house getting rid of your [ __ ] mortgage moving into
1:05:31

1:06:29
okay that [ __ ] [ __ ] you up you [ __ ] okay that's why the [ __ ]
1:06:36
is hard and that's why you stay in you'll stay in because it's too hard to get out it's hard to get out now you
1:06:44
live in Los Angeles wo you don't even know where to go out you can't even get
1:06:50
in y'all complain about the club y'all can't even get in okay look you don't
1:06:56
you stop showing face in La for like a week no one remembers who you are anymore you're yesterday's news [ __ ] off
1:07:02
can't even get in okay but she can get in but you can't get in okay you ain't
1:07:08
getting in she getting in you ain't getting in you ain't getting nowhere okay look the way that this actually works here's how it actually plays out
1:07:15
if you listen to me she immediately gets some hot new stud who is a [ __ ] boy she
1:07:20
thinks she's got a new man and then he pumps and dumps you are a chump virgin
1:07:26
loser for two to three years humiliated like a [ __ ] but at the end of it you
1:07:31
come out super on top like the [ __ ] like the next level version of you that is so high level you will thank her for what
1:07:37
she did okay like so much higher level but that two to three years is humiliating I mean you go from having a
1:07:43
lovely significant other to being thrown in the dirt like yesterday's [ __ ] trash you know you're you're being
1:07:49
rejected by people that you wouldn't have even considered right and the whole time you're in the relationship you're like if I was single it would be awesome
1:07:57
and then you get out there and you're like it's not
1:08:03
awesome okay it's it's it's it is a system [ __ ] shocker okay it will
1:08:10
shock you it will [ __ ] you up so what happens is um you know you have to you
1:08:17
got now you got to re- how to talk like an idiot because when you go out you got to talk like an idiot that's probably the hardest part of this whole thing by
1:08:23
the way right it's like you know because like I remember my buddy Nick you know he's married right and he'd be like you
1:08:28
know I'd be I'd be going on a date and he'd be likeall right so tell what's her name her name is Jen tell Jen to meet up
1:08:36
at 7:20 we're going to be at a hotel lobby on the on the 18th floor she's
1:08:42
going to ask security where it is and then right at right at 7:20 um she's got to be there uh because we're in a
1:08:47
meeting until 7:20 tell her to go back right of course what you learn is when you're single it's like you know it's almost like you got to do like like a
1:08:52
like a you know it's kind like right like State pum State pomp State PP
1:08:58
right just to have any hope in hell you and might five of them maybe one shows up okay you guys didn't know you guys
1:09:03
like huh I never tried so I didn't know that okay so yeah you that's you you book group outings right because a lot
1:09:08
of them flake you know right so you know so you forget right whenever you're in a relationship you know you have a significant other who loves you so they
1:09:16
they will show up at 7:20 and do all that but when it's someone who doesn't know you and they have no investment in you it's like this whole entire like
1:09:22
like cheese maze that you have to build in someone to come and see you okay with like little cheese crumbles and like
1:09:28
like we're going to do this and [ __ ] this thing it's super cool and you know right and it's it's ridiculous so so the
1:09:36
thing is like you know if you haven't built the right cheese Maze and it doesn't wind up at 720 in the 18th floor
1:09:42
um you know that's kind of what you're dealing with right it's it's [ __ ] chaos so now all of a sudden you're like I just want my ex B they would show up
1:09:48
at 720 I didn't need a cheese Maze and I'm up late and I'm [ __ ] tired and my
1:09:54
voice are and I'm lonely and I used to have sex every day and now there's like preum just coming out of my penis and my
1:10:01
underwear cuz I no longer have sex and I just wank it until I'm chafing and I don't know what kind of hand cream to use and I'm alone and she's on a [ __ ]
1:10:08
boat with this [ __ ] and he doesn't love her like I do that happens right and and you're and
1:10:14
you're literally forced to rebuild the [ __ ] thing and the funny thing is it's not even that hard to rebuild like it's not but we make it hard that's a
1:10:19
funny thing we make it hard because we miss what we have even though we didn't have [ __ ] we didn't have [ __ ] we had it
1:10:25
at one point we lost it but we're we're grieving something that no longer existed they were never going to re
1:10:31
resect you and you want to know why they were never going to Rees you well we let's look what they tell you and then we'll look what the truth is what they
1:10:37
tell you is because of this and because of that okay and then you try to decode it
1:10:44
you're like I will decode the blah blah okay you try to decode the [ __ ] thing but in reality what it was was it was
1:10:49
the fact that it would have been that hard for you to replace that's why okay
1:10:55
like Rox can say oh that's a $100,000 watch then they shut down their stores
1:11:01
they shut down their dealers they shut down their demand and then now all of a sudden you can press them to get it for five bucks because the demand isn't
1:11:08
there anymore they've given it up so you gave away what what made um them like
1:11:13
you in the first place you gave that away so now what you do is you go and you rebuild it and you have to take that
1:11:19
love and that care and that passion and put that into going out that means you find out where the venues are that means
1:11:25
that you might have to move from look I don't need to be in shape to go out but most of you guys do because you're can't handle it if you're not because you
1:11:32
don't feel confident if you're not in shape and I know that most you guys can't handle it so I've just come to
1:11:38
accept that over [ __ ] time that you know I tell you guys you don't need it and you're like all [ __ ] all you gotonight I'll show you don't need it
1:11:43
but I sh so get in shape okay for
1:11:50
you okay and then from there okay in reality you should also go out the same time getting sh but what's going to then
1:11:57
happen is uh you know do all the things you need to do and grab look in two years when you've rebuilt it you will be
1:12:03
so proud you'll be so proud of yourself and you will wonder what the hell you're thinking and for a lot of us it's when
1:12:09
we meet someone who is more attractive than the previous person and we have an experience with them and then we go you
1:12:15
know what I wouldn't lose this experience for the world even though I miss that person I wouldn't lose experience for the world that's kind of like your first win okay and then from
1:12:22
there um you know you build back the parties and look if listen to what I'm telling you you will be doing the
1:12:28
coolest [ __ ] [ __ ] you will literally be walking through there like a [ __ ] rock same way that I would hear at this seminar like right here doing this and I
1:12:34
have a certain value here in this room I have 10 times more value if I do a party
1:12:40
both beautiful women so understand like you will actually have that okay it will
1:12:46
happen for you and you'll notice what will happen is when you rebuild it you're going to reflect on what you used
1:12:52
to tolerate and you're going to go how the hell did I do that how was I even around that how was I even okay with
1:12:59
that how did I even allow myself to become that person who was I at the start of that and who was I by the end
1:13:06
and you know there's also things that you did that were your fault and you should reflect on those and I definitely have so it takes you to Tango but I'm
1:13:11
just talking about one side of it here okay so put that love that you have into
1:13:18
building the actual system figure out where to go out begin to go out begin to
1:13:23
build your social media begin to build things that you could invite people to become the social epicenter once you've
1:13:30
done that you can network with other highle business owners you can wind up getting offered awesome jobs you can
1:13:36
wind up building your career now you're doing business you're guys I have a video coming out about this week or uh
1:13:42
this week and you'll literally watch me having beautiful beautiful female friends that I've have coming with me
1:13:47
you'll see other women that that want to talk to me and you'll see people want to do business with me and you'll see I know everybody there and that's it
1:13:53
parties on major Estates why is that happening because I finally wrapped up
1:13:59
what I had going on and I put that same effort into rebuilding my social life and what I've learned is in the future
1:14:07
if I'm in a relationship again I'm not going to do giant parties and you don't have a roster but I will definitely do a
1:14:14
[ __ ] Taco Tuesday repeat this after me [ __ ] Taco
1:14:19
Tuesday okay and what I mean by that is just in the same way that if you're a woman Maybe once a week you go out on a
1:14:26
date and you get dressed up right just just to remind your man hey [ __ ] look
1:14:31
at all these [ __ ] saring me so you need to shut the [ __ ] up okay so and
1:14:37
that's actually healthy like look as men would you say that that's probably healthy for a woman to do that for you right should she just be like because if
1:14:43
she never dolls up and she's just all [ __ ] scrubbed out all the time it's like it's not like you judge her for that but at a certain point you kind of
1:14:48
forget what she was like right well in the same way as a guy you know you're not going to put on high heels and [ __ ]
1:14:54
unless that's your thing but um you know what you would do instead is you just got to show a little
1:15:00
bit of your power a little bit of your clout you know and do it in a casual way yeah you know we're gonna have friends over we're going to do a card game we're
1:15:05
gonna have taco Tuesday invite a bunch of people over guys and girls both and
1:15:12
what'll happen is the women there will see you with a very attractive significant other so they're into you
1:15:17
they kind of want to seal her spot she's going to see a little bit of that but you're just playing cards but let her see it not as a way to cheat or Fidelity
1:15:25
but as a way to as my friend Ty Lopez would say a reminder it is just a
1:15:31
reminder who the [ __ ] you are and don't talk about doing it just [ __ ] do it
1:15:38
okay and then go out and socialize do not allow your social skills to go to
1:15:45
[ __ ] okay it will [ __ ] you in ways that you don't understand do not allow your
1:15:50
social skills to go to [ __ ] it will [ __ ] you because your partner will be getting
1:15:56
approached but you are the proactive person in that equation you probably sto doing it right it will [ __ ] you so H
1:16:03
make sure that you maintain your [ __ ] social skills make sure that you maintain your social network my buddy his wife had him delete his Facebook he
1:16:09
used to do some of the best parties in La his like like delete your Facebook that was this is way back in the day like Myspace Facebook all this stuff he
1:16:16
delet his Facebook right and uh man you should [ __ ] did she take him the
1:16:21
cleaners and divorce holy [ __ ] she took him to the
1:16:26
[ __ ] cleaners okay and by the way I was the best man at that wedding
1:16:33
man was that wedding cute oh it was cute oh it's cute it's cute right he took her
1:16:39
to thanks bro he took her to he took her to 100 countries and then on the and on the 100th country I paid for all this by
1:16:46
the way and then on the 100th country yeah someone I was partnering with 100th
1:16:52
country got a ring I bought that ring too got got his ring out 65k you know you know
1:17:01
65k it's all in days work boys 65k ring private [ __ ] Island turned over baby
1:17:07
I love you I want to spend the rest of my life with you what woman would would not say yes to that private island 100th country the 65k ring come on I get you
1:17:15
guys to take a [ __ ] Cracker Jack ring who's not going to take a 65k ring right so you know the ring right the wedding
1:17:23
the dancing the fun I love you I love you oh right all this [ __ ] right Making
1:17:29
Love on your honeymoon we're going to be together forever that wedding doesn't mean [ __ ] because the institution of
1:17:35
marriage is not respected right there's no longer a social pressure there marriage is going to come back I think
1:17:41
someday but it'll be in a different form and you know why it's going to come back in a different form because women now make more money than men okay so they're
1:17:49
and women are going to start getting fleece and divorces and so you're going to see them go no wait no no no um we're ready to not do that deal any further
1:17:56
and they have collectiv eyes in man heaven so that'll wind up happening um so as a result of that um yeah he got
1:18:03
fleeced and uh you know they never had any kids he could have never known her but he still pays her after for many
1:18:09
years to come even though he could have never known her um you know she was a bartender before right she gave up a
1:18:14
bartending job to support him by the end of it I don't love you you don't love me blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and
1:18:21
you know what's funny about it I remember we used to go out in Vegas right and we fun I remember she'd call him on the phone and go you're not
1:18:27
allowed to go out in Vegas with your friends right that guy was not even allowed to own a pair of shoes and get him in the club he was only allowed to
1:18:33
wear New Balance shoes okay that guy was not even allowed to get a pair of tweezers to plug his nose hairs this is
1:18:41
truth and I love look on your face and literally she's like that she's like why
1:18:48
didn't I think of that so my ex so yeah because anything that would that would
1:18:55
and and she would accuse him like we had this old secretary that was like a Bridge Troll and he would literally
1:19:01
accuse him of banging The Bridge Troll every chance she got you're banging The Bridge
1:19:08
Troll And um yeah and uh I'm like man come on bro ain't nobody banging The Bridge Troll stop it stop it that's like
1:19:16
some inner species [ __ ] stop I'm kidding and uh you know like he's not banging
1:19:23
The Bridge Troll he gave you his ring his countries his shoes his
1:19:28
tweezers he gave you his tweezers he's not bringing the Bridge Troll he's too low level for the Bridge Troll after
1:19:34
your hack job so okay so what H what happened was like
1:19:40
he he gave up what made him attractive and then in the end uh she couldn't get pregnant she was an older older girl she
1:19:46
couldn't get pregnant so they paid oh I paid for this too by the way so she a guy I partner with so she paid because he just got [ __ ] bull he got so whack
1:19:53
with his work he's useless so what happened was um uh I think they paid it was uh I don't know couple hundred K to
1:20:00
make these like zygotes right it's like notice like the the the the reality tunnel of insanity that we're traveling
1:20:07
through now right it's like this like this tunnel that was cre like spin out of thin air like Merlin like this and
1:20:13
now we're just like all right we're going down the reality total of no tweezers no shoes and $100,000 zygotes
1:20:21
let's go you know right and just going down this like reality tunnel say that's what happens when you lose your power I
1:20:28
had people in business that did this to me I've had relationship I've been in relationships where they do this to you they take you down this like like they
1:20:34
they just baby step you into this reality tunnel of such nonsense that by
1:20:40
the end of it you're like okay baby the zygotes the shoes the tweezers the love
1:20:46
the care what do you need to be 5% as good as when we met and when I was not
1:20:53
exclusive right and I remember she said to him I can't have a baby with you with my cuz it was like her egg hybridized
1:21:00
with a sperm that they would get a surrogate for and pay all this money like he's literally going that this guy
1:21:06
even had skills with dating prior to this and he's gone so far down the
1:21:11
rabbit hole of this that it's like baby she he's like baby let's him let's use
1:21:17
the zyo for the the surrogate right and again we'll go make Owen pay and I'm
1:21:23
like sure bro whatever I love you I'll do it and the thing is she told him no you can't do the zygote impregnation
1:21:30
until you have an extra 500k in my bank account to give me a feeling of security because I'm have to raise this kid now
1:21:36
compare this to someone who loves the guy who like met him that night and goes
1:21:42
raw dog which happens all the time right like if someone's really into the guy you know say they're really into the guy
1:21:48
they just forget to use a condom like that shit'll happen like it's nothing but when it's this little reality tunnel
1:21:53
and the D and the fire seller dynamic's been shifted and the value's been lost the respects been lost now it's you will give me the zygote you'll give me the
1:22:00
500k you will not wear the shoes I will [ __ ] [ __ ] you out for banging a Bridge Troll I will do all this I I'm
1:22:07
gonna send this [ __ ] video he's gonna lose his mic okay but and by the end of it here's here's the here's the punch line it's not even funny it just [ __ ]
1:22:14
up okay you want he [ __ ] punch line this guy was like the most confident kind of [ __ ] [ __ ] you've ever
1:22:19
seen this guy would REM out everybody he was a terror to work with Scream at
1:22:24
people didn't give a [ __ ] had no manners whatsoever total [ __ ] prick he was like the suite of of like you know the
1:22:31
[ __ ] that we were doing and but for some reason with her he it's like his karma
1:22:37
would just let him get a spanking like spank spank spank you naughty boy yes baby yes baby yes baby and and she and
1:22:46
he would take it until she fleeced him she [ __ ] fleeced him and um and and
1:22:52
fleeced him in divorce and the thing is um after that he became a completely
1:23:00
different person he was so broken that he he begged her and pleaded with her um
1:23:06
to come back and he was so utterly utterly utterly broken that he never
1:23:12
looked the same he he looked like he was lobotomized say that word after me lobotomized
1:23:17
laomiz so they don't do it on purpose you did it to your damn self I did it to my damn self you he was la lot of eyes
1:23:25
Okay so yeah everyone comes up to me like dude he's not the same anymore like he
1:23:30
just doesn't look the same it's like [ __ ] weird like what happened to this [ __ ] guy it's just he looks weird now because what happens is you give away
1:23:36
your whole [ __ ] soul you know it's it's like when you do an approach the wrong way and you give up too much your
1:23:43
soul and then you feel weird after but it's like the megga
1:23:50
do I just like saying that ra ra ah how many more times that funny still less
1:23:59
funny no okay so yeah it's the lobotomization it's basically just you
1:24:05
know you gave yourself away you get lobotomized and then what happens is
1:24:10
because you're lobotomized then what happens is like you go to meet somebody new but you got
1:24:15
no swag because you're this emptied out husk lobotomize chump who's like love me
1:24:25
n love me love me n are you so and so like
1:24:33
named your ex like say it with Sarah are you Sarah right like you're just trying to replace so they don't like you they
1:24:39
they a't having it it's drug addict Behavior again addiction is when previously you had many areas that
1:24:46
supplied you happiness and fulfillment and emotional equilibrium and emotional regulation and fulfillment and it fed
1:24:51
your soul and then what happens is one thing feeds your soul you allow that to
1:24:57
happen you no longer are the person who they could respect they leave you beg
1:25:04
they negotiate worse and worse deals you say yes they lose further respect they
1:25:09
become [ __ ] demonic power Trippers not the person who you met you get
1:25:15
lobotomized you give away your soul they leave you're empty you beg you plead
1:25:21
then you're told no you've got to go to the gy you've got to go out you've got to meet people you've got to rebuild
1:25:26
you've got to do a party and you go no no no no no no I don't want to do a
1:25:32
party I just want give
1:25:37
me okay and you're [ __ ] so you have to
1:25:43
have what's called a protocol y'all okay a protocol and with that protocol it has
1:25:49
to be okay look this is where this is gone I love this person I wish I pray
1:25:55
that we could have what we had but that ship has sailed once you've lost respect it's done guys okay guy or girl it's not
1:26:02
about women it's not about men it's guy or girl they don't respect you anymore
1:26:07
and if previously they put you on a pedestal you had a version of them and
1:26:13
there that version still exists for the [ __ ] on the boat okay for that other [ __ ] but not for you
1:26:19
you're not going to get that side of them again and you you miss that tender sweet eat love and when you go out you
1:26:27
know what you see you see coldhearted transactional empty shells
1:26:32
you feel it you're like like you you had this this like there's a tangible love
1:26:38
and like I know this sounds [ __ ] crazy but there's like this is real there's an energy of love in your home
1:26:45
when you have a significant other who brings love to it it's magic it's [ __ ] magic and what happens is like
1:26:51
you know you go out and and you see other people that but have also been traumatized and they've kind of closed
1:26:57
off like when you go back out like like your ex man you could like asked them to
1:27:02
shave your back you could have [ __ ] farted and they would have G you fart the baby that's so cute you're like a
1:27:08
little baby I love that B Spot it's my it's my favorite spot right and then you
1:27:14
you may be Power Trip a little bit you're like yeah I got this [ __ ] on lock y'all she even likes my bald spot this
1:27:19
[ __ ] likes my farts right you're like you're thinking like that they'll clip that for sure in the next media scandal right so yeah it's a joke but okay no
1:27:28
joking so it's all so serious so what happens is like um you know so you think
1:27:35
that you're that guy you go out and like when you go back out here's what you don't realize like when I first went back out I remember I invited some
1:27:41
people back and like it was just kind of like cold in my house and just because it was cold they're like we're leaving
1:27:47
and I'm like just cuz it's a little bit cold suddenly I appreciate the mic's a little bit more I'm like you know what she put up a lot of [ __ ] that a lot
1:27:54
of these a lot of these new people would not put up with because they're not in love with you so they are purely there
1:28:01
for the transaction they're just there to get good emotions right I remember that night I ran downstairs I got all these uh all these uh winter jackets I
1:28:07
got a bunch of winner like Canada Goose and Monclair jackets I I brought them up then they pose in the winter jackets I'm like oh okay we got it still popping
1:28:13
here and um you know that was fine but I realized I'm like man like I gotta I got to get it popping up here I had to put
1:28:20
about 50 $60,000 in my crib because frankly i' let it fall into disrepair in the
1:28:26
past four or five years we mostly traveled I didn't really need my house to be that much in repair do you guys see the the crib now in the lives it's
1:28:32
got all those lights in it it's all [ __ ] crazy cuz the house looks like a [ __ ] nightclub now but you know that was about 50 60k in renovations on the
1:28:38
house I had to go forend promoters now you guys know [ __ ] promoters how they are right you know promoters any you
1:28:43
guys know promoters it's like demon scum so you have to go friend okay hope they
1:28:49
didn't make it this this deep in the video they probably haven't because they're on cocaine so that's the truth
1:28:55
that's the truth it's true I can say that knowing I might lose my promoter connects but they won't make it this far
1:29:02
but if they did make it this far I just want to let you know that I I talk about the other
1:29:07
promoters okay so okay you do not have a cocaine problem sir so yeah a lot of
1:29:13
these promoters they get involved in that lifestyle they just they're just living the moment it's like [ __ ] stupid so they're good guys you know they just they live in the moment so
1:29:20
anyway so what happens is now you're beting promoters now you're beting uh all these people um you know and it's
1:29:28
very very cold it's very very transactional but you know what you realize here's what you realize over time a lot of the people that you're meeting seem cold but they've been hurt
1:29:35
too and and the way that they cope is they go into this place where they're very closed off and if they meet the
1:29:40
right person they can eventually actually open up but it's a process so the so they have a process that they
1:29:46
have to go through and you have a process that you'll have to go through and you're you're now facing this you will not likely get a significant other
1:29:52
until you do not want a significant other okay now take this from me I've taught this for two decades the behavior
1:30:00
pattern that I have seen is that every guy who says I don't want to go out I
1:30:07
just want lovey [Music]
1:30:14
doy love every guy that says that can't find it say they're [ __ ] life okay to
1:30:19
to if they had a gun at their [ __ ] head they will drive everybody away but the second that a guy comes to me he's
1:30:25
like you know what I've realized I [ __ ] love being single [ __ ] relationships I never want to be in a
1:30:31
relationship I I will literally Point them go you will be in a relationship in 10 days okay 10 days later you will have
1:30:38
met the love of your life you'll go that was crazy I believe in love I'm in love and you will be in relationship because
1:30:44
what will happen is you'll now be desirable right so what has happened is um to be specific there's an energetic
1:30:49
shift so the energetic shift is that previously it was an energy of taking and then because you were unfulfilled
1:30:56
and they feel that from you and you're like but see what you're doing is you're justifying you're going no no it's not a
1:31:01
it's not that I'm a [ __ ] beta black hole [ __ ] black hole beta Triple B it
1:31:07
is that I am a lover right and you're like I'm a lover so I just want love and
1:31:13
so you say that to yourself but really what it is is it that you're a lover oh you're just a lover and I'm the bad man
1:31:20
and you're the lover you have moral superiority don't you you're just I'm the lover and I I love connection and
1:31:28
you're just the cold man the cold bad man and I'm the good man because Society
1:31:34
tells you that love is the most important thing and I want love and you're the bad man but in reality you're
1:31:40
not the lover good man you are a [ __ ] and the reason why you're a [ __ ] is
1:31:46
because you're [ __ ] lazy you want to live in your [ __ ] Suburban house where you're comfortable you don't want
1:31:52
to have to go out you don't want to have to use your [ __ ] voice cuz your voice got sore when you went out you don't want have to go meet someone cuz you can't know the rejection cuz you're a
1:31:57
[ __ ] you you don't want to actually have to socialize you don't want to actually have to put the money into getting a good party location or getting
1:32:03
a good container event or networking or meeting people or putting in the time you don't want to rebuild you don't want to go to the gym you don't want to
1:32:09
rebuild your wardrobe you don't want to have to actually be happy because you even got addicted to negativity and fighting in the back half of the
1:32:15
relationship so you're just addicted to [ __ ] arguments all day you can't handle just laughing with people and being [ __ ] social and actually
1:32:20
enjoying it so it actually sucks energy from you to be happy because you just want to be miserable like in your
1:32:26
[ __ ] tail in your relationship so now you're stuck there that's not you believing in love that is you being a
1:32:32
[ __ ] lazy sucker [ __ ] and you don't want to do it you're not morally Superior you're [ __ ] lazy okay you're
1:32:39
not willing to embrace the process so embrace the process and what you do is
1:32:46
you say to yourself okay look I am currently addicted on one thing I'm I my my brain and my energetic system is
1:32:54
wired to be hooked on this one thing and I need to disperse and defuse my energy
1:33:01
inputs so that's where simple examples and maybe I'll if I put this out on video I'll decide L this might be a
1:33:06
little too crazy little too hot for the current air we'll decide later maybe do it maybe not but what you do is um you
1:33:12
do a beach party as an example you know you you go you meet a bunch of female friends and guess what guys you got to put in time with those female friends
1:33:18
they're not just going to be your female friend you don't go you're my female friend I'm [ __ ] lazy but just follow me doesn't work like that you got to put
1:33:24
in time spend time get to know them right so you make a bunch of female friends you make some cool guy friends guys that actually have a little bit of
1:33:30
swagger guys a little bit of fun that don't annoy the girls and then you know you put a party on the and again cost
1:33:35
money you go get a couple little tables you put like a white sheet on them you tell everybody to wear white and gold
1:33:41
and you go out to the [ __ ] you go out and you do a beach party maybe like 10 guys 10 girls you get a bonfire going
1:33:48
and now you put it on your uh on your Instagram stories right and then the other girls see it the guys see it it looks [ __ ] cool
1:33:54
and you know what's funny about this whole thing you have a great time you actually do you have a great [ __ ] time right so you can be
1:34:00
like I don't want to actually have to do anything you could say that or you can
1:34:05
embrace the [ __ ] beach party now that that beach party thing I think I did that last week and I went to
1:34:12
aroan and anyone who's from the West Coast knows the price of aroan right anyone know the world's most snobby
1:34:20
grocery store featuring The Haley Bieber smoothie that every girl will drink and so I
1:34:28
bought $200 in steak and another $100 in the items because you got to bring
1:34:33
something to picnic other your [ __ ] appetite right so I contribute that party my other friends bought pillows
1:34:38
they bought tables and they put it together everyone's got to throw down a little bit that's part of life you got to pay to play sometimes right now it
1:34:43
sucks when you're just having a relationship and you could have put that money into your partner right and now you're like well now I'm going to go
1:34:48
through this party I didn't even know I'm going to see any of these people again and that's kind of part of it you know you do you do any kind a party you
1:34:54
don't even know what you're investing into but at the end of the day what were you really investing into before someone who hates you someone who doesn't
1:35:00
respect you what did you really lose so rather than being pissed that you're putting a little bit of paper into who
1:35:07
knows what it's a risk it's a gamble you say to yourself you know what better than saying that [ __ ] even if you love
1:35:14
the person but but the dynamic had gone to [ __ ] even though they're not [ __ ] but the dynamic went to [ __ ] cuz there was too much slippage in the dynamic you let
1:35:21
it get away from you so now out on the beach and you're having a party and and you know maybe you meet someone maybe
1:35:27
you have a lovely night out on the beach together with someone special that night and you're like you know what it's still
1:35:32
not my partner who I love to death but you got to understand something that version of them that version is never
1:35:38
coming back that's not for you anymore that's for somebody else now somebody
1:35:44
else has that not you that's not available to you anymore so guys rather
1:35:50
than than being stuck on the past and fixating on it embrace the future embrace the beach party Embrace fixing
1:35:59
your house up embrace the gym Embrace laughing with your buddies you know what it means maybe you set up that trip to
1:36:05
Vegas with your buddies maybe you do that nature trip with your friends and by the way after a
1:36:12
breakup there's two parts I think are the weirdest things actually I'm going to say three the three parts that are the
1:36:18
weirdest things are first of all I would say the quietness it's just eerily
1:36:25
eerily quiet after a breakup isn't it because you're used to doing things
1:36:31
you're significant other right you go to the spa with them you go to the gym with them you go on trips with them so
1:36:36
there's always this kind of dialogue going on between you in your partner they're your other half right it's beautiful it's a beautiful thing and all
1:36:43
that you hear now like my memories of like my most significant breakup you know how I think of it in my head it's
1:36:49
just the sound like this is a rug but imagine if this was not a rug it was like wood or something louder it's just the sound of
1:36:57
feet it's a lot of [ __ ] feet
1:37:03
feet feet feet and
1:37:17
breathing that's how I breathe out of my breakup y'all okay why cuz you're alone
1:37:24
you're [ __ ] alone you're just like before you're like oh what do you think of this oh no way oh cool yeah cool yeah
1:37:30
you know [ __ ] right where are they now they're gone some other dick up in them
1:37:36
some other cream pie up in them it ain't you baby it's for somebody else now not you
1:37:42
okay there's uh Hodge twins they help guys get her her breakups they go she getting nuts and they go all kinds of
1:37:49
nuts right it's like a way to help guys to help guys get over they go they go oh kinds of nuts like all this actually
1:37:55
watch it you're like I'm done I'm done right so yeah they get think like they get to move on it's like the like the most brutal move on vide you guys ever
1:38:00
seen these videos of hot TRS man you cannot help but to move on when you listen to this they get you to imagine your girlfriend getting pumped with
1:38:06
cream pies by yeah I okay just watch it so yeah you're like I'm over it so no
1:38:12
but it's like it's just very it's very [ __ ] quiet you know it's like you used to talk laugh you had a human warm
1:38:19
body on you hugging you kissing you stroking you talking to you validating
1:38:24
you joking with you talking to you joking you so that's being a [ __ ] [ __ ] joking you you know right and then
1:38:30
it's just like this Loop and all of a sudden you're like I even take the [ __ ] back I just a lonely this is [ __ ]
1:38:40
weird you know you just sit at the spa you're like hey baby hey
1:38:47
baby baby and like then you think to yourself like she's back somewhere El ahhh and
1:38:53
it's not you right you're like how did this happen my baby how did it happen
1:38:58
and you know and and what happens is um you wish that you could meet somebody else as broken as you and you just
1:39:05
[ __ ] fix each other and just sub each other out and just have the problem go away um so it's a lot of it's a lot of
1:39:10
quietness that's the first one that's the the first one that hits you is the quietness the second one that's going to hit you is uh the uh lack of love in the
1:39:18
house right there's like a tangible magical potion of love that's in your house and you probably took it for Grand
1:39:25
a little bit when you're in it and they pull it away that goes to them and you know what your house feels like a [ __ ] a [ __ ] DMV or
1:39:32
Hospital you know what I'm saying it feels like a [ __ ] DMV or [ __ ] hospital it's [ __ ] weird dude you sit
1:39:37
in your house by yourself you're like hey Mr House what's up Mr house it's just me
1:39:44
and you I'm finally free I can jerk off to whatever [ __ ]
1:39:51
bottle of hand cream I want yeah right
1:39:58
just just go through your [ __ ] house and you go hey then the house goes like that like it vibrates you know like a
1:40:03
little echo in your [ __ ] house Ed just alone right so it's the Ed so first one is quiet the second one is the Love
1:40:12
potion's Gone the third one is you're used to having sex every day without a
1:40:17
condom now you've got to masturbate furiously every day
1:40:23
perhaps some pictures of your ex you know right who you know is [ __ ] some other dude but you can only come to her
1:40:29
now funny enough when you were together you couldn't wait for her to [ __ ] go on vacation so you could load up that
1:40:35
PornHub but for some reason when she dumped you now you can only jerk off to
1:40:44
her the irony that talk about being put in your place I have been put in my place so I
1:40:51
had to I had to laugh you know hey you know someday what did David Chappelle say he's like sometimes you're in
1:40:56
somebody else's movie what does it what do he say at the end of that one sometime what is the dreamer some sometimes you're in somebody else's dream you know right sometimes you're
1:41:03
somebody else's dream baby you know right imagine how happy she'd be knowing that you're just crying jerking off to her like man I love you oh the pleasure
1:41:11
the the Redemption the the satisfaction so that's where you're at so now
1:41:17
basically it's just this combination of like breathing stepping quiet hospital
1:41:24

1:42:24
right so yeah so I mean that's that's kind of where you're at right and because you allowed it to get to that
1:42:29
point you you allowed you allowed yourself to be steered there through failure of [ __ ] testing and [ __ ]
1:42:37
caving and okay so you let yourself get there that's where you are congrats okay but
1:42:46
if you were to get a video of that I should have why the [ __ ] did I not video this [ __ ] because if you would have seen
1:42:52
me in the hottest [ __ ] party in Los Angeles the other night man that [ __ ] would look pimp so it's one of these
1:42:59
things where you'll get there right you you will you will rebuild you guys saw me I was on a broken leg I'm still kind
1:43:05
of gimping around here do you guys see that [ __ ] you guys see my accident broken leg tib fib tibial Plateau common nuded
1:43:14
fracture the [ __ ] nurses were crying and [ __ ] they felt so bad for me and I I didn't even know if I could walk in now
1:43:19
I'm I'm hiking I'm walking you know things are looking up and up right we do heal take enough calcium pills and
1:43:26
enough [ __ ] rehab and eventually you shall walk again okay so what is the
1:43:32
calcium pills and what is the rehab for these situations well it's like I told
1:43:38
you you've got to you've got to get clear in your protocol you've got to get clear in what it is that you're going to
1:43:44
do that means for most of you who can't handle going out without being in the gym cuz you can't do it you're going to
1:43:51
have to be back in the gym okay and frankly I also would say that the gym is a great a great way to burn off steam
1:43:58
okay to actually kind of push you the pain of what's happened um then what you got to do is you're going to have to
1:44:03
move and you're going to have to move somewhere in proximity where you can meet new people you're going to have to set up your place to do dinner party set
1:44:08
up your place to do um you know if you want to do a rager you've got to know how to do that you've got to execute it carefully not wind up yourself in some
1:44:14
hot water but got do it right okay iding at the door proper bartenders to make
1:44:20
sure no one gets over served all that kind of stuff you got to be smart legal and on the up and up about it okay dot
1:44:25
your ti dot your eyes and cross your tees okay dot your tees and cross your
1:44:30
eyes do what you got to do so um you've got to do that you've got to go reuf friend a bunch of cool people
1:44:36
to go out with um you've got to find out where to go uh you got to start enjoying your life again you got to start walking
1:44:43
down the street and enjoying the [ __ ] roses you've got to be at the point
1:44:49
where and you go there's a tree there's a cool building and you've got
1:44:55
to actually enjoy it and train yourself to do it without having to always be talking to somebody they may wind up
1:45:01
jumping in with someone new right away because they couldn't go through that quiet you know and that's fine that's fine everybody's where they're at but if
1:45:07
you decide to take this journey you Embrace that quiet you know it's quiet it sucks but you are not whing up
1:45:14
permanently lobotomized okay like my buddy okay you're not going to wind up permanently
1:45:20
lobotomized and um you got to say like I ain't going out like that like this is not going to be me I'm not going out
1:45:26
like that and the problem is the older that you get the harder that it is to go back out and you see other people that
1:45:32
are younger going back out and you go I can't do it it's too hard I just want
1:45:37
this problem to go away and so on and so forth and that [ __ ] ain't go away okay the flip side of it that is good is you
1:45:44
will have experiences that you would have never had okay you'll have experience that you would have never had you'll probably wind up messing it up
1:45:50
with a bunch of new people because you you wind up with somebody new you'll [ __ ] that up because you're still needy you're still not healed you wind up like
1:45:57
the next person you're going to vent about your X2 247 you're going to vent they did this they did that [ __ ] this [ __ ] [ __ ] that so the person's like okay
1:46:05
you're [ __ ] crazy uh good you know right and they and they seem to be listening at first and then over time they you just realize You' been a
1:46:11
[ __ ] [ __ ] and I did a bit of it my a bunch of my friends have done it and my friends will do this and I'll be like you got to shut the [ __ ] up and they're
1:46:17
like no no she she says she likes hearing about my ex you know right she says she likes it
1:46:23
you know no bro she likes you and she's tolerating it you need to shut the [ __ ] up now um but you can't help it cuz
1:46:29
you're looping right and you you'll [ __ ] that up and then uh you're you're looping on it and so on and so forth and
1:46:35
uh you'll probably [ __ ] up four or five of them and then guess what'll happen you'll be probably you'll be at the place where I'm pretty much at now where
1:46:42
you don't even want a relationship because you're having too much fun because what happens is you wind up putting so much time into building the
1:46:48
machine and the mentalities and the inner fortitude and the behaviors and the infrastructure and the places to go
1:46:53
and the fun the Charisma and all that stuff you rebuild it to the point that you're not easy to get anymore and what
1:46:58
do you become like what do you become like the [ __ ] that's in demand the [ __ ] that gets
1:47:05
treated properly the [ __ ] that is rare the [ __ ] that has value because you don't just get it and because other
1:47:11
people get told no and you've told people no and that gets around and then
1:47:17
word gets around if you're known in your area of oh who's going to get them and you become kind of like that guy in
1:47:23
demand and then and then they're kind of curious um who's going to get you and then what happens is now you got too
1:47:29
many options and then you kind of start being like what the and what happens then you look back at your PR you're like what the [ __ ] was I doing what the
1:47:37
[ __ ] was that what the who the [ __ ] didn't tell me what I was doing you look at your friends like you let me do this
1:47:42
[ __ ] you let me do this [ __ ] what the [ __ ] bro I thought homies right and they're like you look
1:47:49
lobotomized bro you look like you had your [ __ ] Soul ripped out of your body and uh you come back you'll bounce
1:47:57
back and um I think the big thing is that once you come back from that here
1:48:02
is the main key you've now built the protocol of what to do in these situations which are can be very
1:48:08
complicated for a man so you've rebuilt the protocol you know what to do but
1:48:13
here's the funny thing okay what do you think is going to make your next relationship more safe reading another
1:48:19
version of John gry from Mars from Venus marriage counseling or actually having a
1:48:28
backbone look those other things help too right it's not all backbone but it's having a [ __ ] backbone the reason
1:48:34
that they lost respect was because it was that hard for you to rebuild that process now do you want to know the sad
1:48:39
truth of this I'm kind of [ __ ] with y'all right now you want to know why I'm [ __ ] with you guys right now because I know that many of you in this room
1:48:46
have not even built that process even once you guys didn't give up a roster
1:48:51
because you never had one I'm [ __ ] with you yes be quiet in shame so what I'm
1:49:00
you never even had it you never even got far enough to have your head kicked
1:49:06
in right right how many of you guys in here
1:49:12
have truly built the machine that I'm even talking about in the first place let don't having to rebuild it put your hands up look at that
1:49:18
[ __ ] small handful of people now for those of you guys that have built it how awesome is it when you built it oh

1:50:28
currently today but how fun was it when you were single prior of that oh it was great yeah it was it was he didn't sound like he like that much it was great
1:50:33
great it was it was a good time okay nice who else actually built it out proper proper anybody yeah how was it
1:50:41
absolutely incredible rotational for girls parties I give it up for this
1:50:46
beautiful girl who I thought who I thought was so amazing kicks my head in
1:50:51
and then it feels like eating uh sandwich out of plastic bag after eating
1:50:56
a steak yeah go out for a year yeah yeah lobotomize right did you get lobotomized
1:51:02
yeah me too bro it's all good okay we come back right how much your brain grew
1:51:07
back stronger than ever good [ __ ] yeah I'm working on my brain coming back but you know it's coming back so yeah who
1:51:13
else has been like really built it up in a major way anybody yep you built it up big time how was it U yeah just Rampage
1:51:20
yeah all over super fun yeah yeah did you also get a significant other get destroyed after
1:51:26
yeah right so see I look like I'm a like for those of you guys haven't been through this like is this is really what happens right and then you ask everybody
1:51:32
and it happened the reason why it happens is because for most of us who built that up we were a little bit more
1:51:37
beta we were a little bit more shy and then we kind of built it up and we kind of didn't know what we're doing but really we just want to love the whole
1:51:43
time and so then when we got it we kind of caved too quick threw up the wi fight too quick and then what happened was we
1:51:50
weren't really living that life fully as much as we could and then what happens is is because we just wanted love and
1:51:55
security the whole time um we didn't fully embrace it and as a result it was like building a home where the
1:52:00
foundation wasn't set it's like building a a dam but the dam isn't strong so the only way that that dam is strong enough
1:52:07
to provide containment for that relationship is if you know what you would do when single that's it you have
1:52:12
to know this goes for women I'm talking a lot about the men experience women have their own version of this usually
1:52:18
involves a bunch of like self-love and massages and sound bass but believe it or not that's tough for them
1:52:24
too even though it's like as a guy you're like come on you know like I just got to get go to a sound bath that's it you guys know what I'm
1:52:30
talking about you guys are drawing blanks for a little bit you know because this is f I'm saying some funny [ __ ] you guys aren laughing thank you yeah this
1:52:36
is like no but this is some funny [ __ ] you guys know what I'm talking about cuz for them okay you guys know my homie Aaron dowy right they just go listen to
1:52:42
Aaron basically okay you know Aaron is like okay so hey guys Aaron's gonna see this guys like it's
1:52:49
Aaron and you are awesome just you are awesome and they're like I am awesome
1:52:55
and then they get a new boyfriend that's basically like look I think this is funny you guys just don't understand what the [ __ ] I'm talking okay I'm let
1:53:01
me break this down a little bit more okay as a man you go you it's like what you have to do is this very work action
1:53:07
Massive Action intensive behavior for like several years right and it's very very difficult involves brutal vicious
1:53:14
rejection and hell but for a lot of girls they what they go through is like they just have to like like get their
1:53:19
inner Radiance back so it's like you are a beautiful princess you're a beautiful princess no you're a beautiful princess
1:53:26
I am a beautiful princess and that's like basically what basically what they do and then they go
1:53:31
to like the sound bath and they like cry like it's okay baby and they're like I'm going to sound bath I'm going to have a
1:53:37
release so I can get back my iter radians and I can attract and manifest a guy I'm going to manifest right do we
1:53:42
get to manifest what the [ __ ] do we manifest a [ __ ] hand cream so you know so it's like I'm me a manifest
1:53:48
right and then they go then they get their inner Radiance back like I just realized that when I have a my Radiance back I go out and I'm manifesting
1:53:55
everything I manifest a private plan and I manifest money and I got this new purse and I'm manifes Aaron Dy [ __ ]
1:54:03
told me they're manifested I went to Costa Rica okay anyway love you bro
1:54:10
okay all right if you know you know so that's basically kind of what happens
1:54:16
okay um so you all you have to get back your inner Radiance and all this other [ __ ] so um but basically what happens is
1:54:24
uh but you know what it's tough for them too it it is it's act when when they're traumatized and they're hurt and and
1:54:30
they're kind of this gaping energetic vicious like this wound it is tough for them to get that so it's everybody has
1:54:35
their path and what's you know a struggle for them so it's real but it's just kind of like it is what it is um
1:54:43
so yeah um you get it back guys okay you will get it back but this was also
1:54:49
sometimes I have I have a hidden lesson contained within it which is that for a lot y'all you haven't even got your first one okay you haven't even got your
1:54:56
face kicked in yet so what I'm going to suggest to you guys is that I will teach
1:55:02
you step one how to get your [ __ ] face kicked
1:55:07
in okay so if you want to learn how to get your face kicked
1:55:14
in okay if that's appealing to you then you've got to you've got to actually learn the process to even meet someone
1:55:21
really good in the first place okay um and that involves understanding social skills how to meet new people how to set
1:55:29
up um things like events Social Circles fun things and you've got to go about
1:55:35
that process and what'll happen for most of you is you'll do that now if you just do the [ __ ] Taco Tuesday you're
1:55:42
not going to go through this hell that everybody else went through but for most of you here you will not do the taco
1:55:49
Tuesday and I say that metaphorically doesn't have to be Taco Tuesday some guys like taco Tuesday has always Taco
1:55:54
Tuesday but like by Taco Tuesday I just mean something fun and social that you
1:56:00
sustain in a relationship keep doing your gym because most of you need to um
1:56:06
you know keep socializing if you keep that and you keep a backbone and you don't move to
1:56:13
the BBS prematurely you'll be fine you won't get screwed but because most
1:56:19
people will cave because you just want love and you and look the truth is here's what happens you just want love
1:56:27
and then you look at a speech like this and you go yeah I like go and everything but he's kind of too hardcore and this is what happens with
1:56:33
everybody ah it's a little hardcore and then what happens is you get in a relationship and you think it can never
1:56:39
happen to you I thought it could never happen to me to be honest I thought it could never happen to me you know what I'm saying right you thought it could never happen to you because too good
1:56:45
that could never happen to me and uh later it does it it it can and it will
1:56:50
happen and it will happen as predictably as the sun coming up and
1:56:55
the sun coming down it is absolutely predictable this will happen to everybody um and so it's not about just
1:57:01
being like Oh love love love love love it's also it's about having love but it's also about embracing heartbreak and
1:57:07
it's also about being a realist and being objective and being an empiricist and so you have yes yes guys you have to
1:57:12
have a backbone yes guys that applies in business yes guys that applies in any social relationship at all if people
1:57:18
don't sense a boundary you will have problems okay and a boundary has to be real and a boundary cannot be fake and
1:57:24
if the boundary is fake it will eventually be exposed to be fake and the only way that you have a real boundary
1:57:30
is if you do have the capacity to meet somebody else and for most of you you can't even meet your first person yet but certainly once you do you can't meet
1:57:37
your second you can't meet your third and that's that so even if in your current stagnant wanker lifestyle you
1:57:45
finally met somebody you catch my joke okay I just lace that in there um in the current
1:57:52
yanky time lifesty if you finally met somebody you wouldn't really have them
1:57:57
because you didn't properly build it out so I would say to every single one of
1:58:03
you in here to make a commitment to learning social skills learn the damn social skills guys now how do you think
1:58:10
I learned how to free associate and just talk [ __ ] like this where' I learn that from how'd I learn this was it just me
1:58:16
doing public speaking where did I learn to be free associative and crack little dumb jokes and all that stuff that's valuable when you go out where did I
1:58:21
learn that going out going out right where I learn how to project my voice I'm not using speakers right now where' I learn that going out right so you know
1:58:30
where did I learn how to control my state you're like is that that thing you
1:58:35
talk about the going out again okay I heard about this going out thing right okay um I learn going out
1:58:44
teaches you State control it teaches you emotional regulation it teaches you how to meet new people it teaches you communication skills it teaches you
1:58:52
skills that are translatable and that are high return on investment so for me
1:58:58
working on social skills um I've used that to train high paid business
1:59:03
Executives to communicate with their staff or to communicate on their own social media I've trained people to be an ambassador for their brand social
1:59:10
media is probably the single biggest digital Gold Rush right now and most people are not using social media
1:59:15
effectively right you guys realize for any one of you working some [ __ ] job you could just learn these skills and go
1:59:21
across social media but of course you won't do it right you could just go do it what do you do for work um advocate
1:59:27
for Freedom mortgage uh mortgage cool lender servic how about this advocate
1:59:33
for whatever the [ __ ] that was or get paid millions of dollars to be an
1:59:38
idiot like me okay thank you so that's what I'm getting at is you can make money from
1:59:45
this [ __ ] okay like I've taught many of the top social media influencers and most of them I make them go out I'm like
1:59:51
look if you cannot hold attention of a random person when you're out you're not going to hold someone's attention on camera okay so so in my case by the way
1:59:59
because I have built Social Circles because I do have parties and all that I never have to go out again I don't need
2:00:04
to go anywhere the best place for me to go out is my house my house is a nightclub it's baller and it's and and
2:00:11
it's better people there than any club in La so I don't need to go out why do I go out to get rejected why do I like
2:00:19
being rejected because you get rejected when you're energ is off so it trains
2:00:24
you to have energetic control how am I able to how long have I been speaking up here I've been up here all afternoon up
2:00:31
here all [ __ ] night and I'll be up here all tomorrow and all tomorrow [ __ ] night and my energy is well
2:00:38
manage I understand how to keep energy moving out where did I learn all this was I born with it did I pop out my
2:00:43
mother's womb public speaking I mean thanks Mom that one was great I'm ready
2:00:48
to face the world where's the seminar room okay I got that and the ability to make
2:00:54
dumb jokes like that from being free associative from going [ __ ] out okay
2:01:01
so what I'm trying to show you is a metaphor what I'm saying you made yourself vulnerable you gave up your
2:01:07
roster you gave up your your thing that you built I know that most of you have never built it I'm saying that to [ __ ]
2:01:12
with you to get you thinking ahead of the problem okay to make you understand that the problem doesn't go away when
2:01:19
you meet one person you're thinking if I can get meet one person I will find the
2:01:24
love and it's just not true it's not [ __ ] true than yeah it's just not [ __ ] true you've got okay you cannot
2:01:32
keep someone who you could not replace and you can't replace a specific person and you can't replace the shared
2:01:38
memories and you can't replace that specific love but you should at least be able to meet someone at that same level
2:01:44
within say two or three weeks okay so that's how you that's how you you could just throw that over to me let's play
2:01:50
catch okay so yeah you have you have to get it to where um you can replace them
2:01:56
okay guys just like in my business I can never do a shared backend with coaches
2:02:01
it's it's a vulnerability it's not me being negative it is [ __ ] with human nature it's
2:02:09
like if I take this [ __ ] watch off and I leave it on the [ __ ] desk and I leave it there for the next two days and I go no one take it okay come on bro at
2:02:17
what point am I the idiot here like yes the person who took it's a [ __ ] but at what point is it kind of my fault too
2:02:24
okay yes if you don't have the ability to meet somebody new and they're mean about that they're kind of being a dick
2:02:31
but if you leave the watch on the on the table you're as you're as dumb as the person that took it okay so if you're
2:02:38
trying to meet someone special who you're really into you have to have the capacity to meet people like them that
2:02:43
doesn't mean you won't be hurt doesn't mean you won't be sad doesn't mean you won't cry in your own crusty [ __ ] while
2:02:50
thinking of them but what it what it but what it does mean is there's at least some kind of a [ __ ] boundary okay and
2:02:58
again you use these skill sets um in order to change your life in other ways
2:03:04
so guys don't forget to learn social skills okay so what this is going to allow you
2:03:11
to do is have a [ __ ] boundary and it's going to allow you to empower yourself and it's going to allow you not to wind up [ __ ] lobotomized okay
2:03:18
because you'll see guys and women who have breakups never come back that's what you guys understand when I called
2:03:24
my buddy every day for like a year he would have never come back but that's with me as his coach for an hour day and
2:03:30
he did bounce back but that's me as coach an hour day and you can't afford that okay
2:03:35
so understand what you think will be your greatest Victory which is getting a
2:03:41
significant other will can wind up being what lobotomized you for real like that
2:03:46
[ __ ] can mess you up okay you're bringing something into
2:03:52
your inner ecosystem that leaves that can leave you demolished absolutely demolished years
2:03:58
of your life spent feeling gutted out because all that beautiful reception of
2:04:05
good energy from many sources now got put on One Source and then it got taken away so you're the
2:04:11
you're literally the equivalent of an exh heroin junkie from that relationship it's rough okay but even in saying that
2:04:19
many of you now haven't even set that up right many many of you now have not even set up those ecosystems to find
2:04:24
fulfillment and joy in many different areas do you remember the speech from earlier where I talked about real fulfillment a lot of that came from this
2:04:31
this is more of that was a more inspirational speech this is more of a crass idiotic speech quite different
2:04:37
speeches aren't they I like to do different speeches for anyone who just got here you should have seen the earlier speech so right um but that was
2:04:45
a more inspiring speech but this is just meant to be a little bit more fun um but basically it's just me kind of shooting
2:04:50
the [ __ ] and piping off and what I would tell you is um it can really [ __ ] you up
2:04:56
but it can also be something that empowers you and I really believe that everybody has to go through a horrific
2:05:02
horrific breakup everybody has to learn what it feels like to have their boundaries uh push too far everybody has
2:05:08
to see what it feels like to become someone who you don't recognize that process that you're going through if you're if someone is watching it now if
2:05:14
you're going through it now I've been through it many people in the Stream been through it some of you got to go through your first one but it's it's
2:05:19
actually more beautiful thing that you think of it's handled the right way I wouldn't change it okay what happened I wouldn't change that doesn't mean that
2:05:25
the person wasn't awesome you don't miss him but I wouldn't change it okay because what it forces you to do it
2:05:31
forces you to do things you never would have done to improve yourself it's much like entrepreneurship right where like a
2:05:37
lot of my progress entrepreneurship um you know like even learning how to public speak for this many hours came
2:05:42
out of recession when we were in an economic recession 2008 I had to learn how to run events this long right so
2:05:47
things that you would have never signed up for wind up being the most important things your life and I think what you'll find is like going through something
2:05:54
like this could be the most important thing in your life okay it really could be a beautiful thing so I'm going to answer
2:06:00
some questions um but I hope that leads you with an empowering message in some direction that uh yeah you know you go
2:06:05
through something tough it can actually be very beautiful but you have to recognize you know you have to have that point where again you know that you know
2:06:11
the bronze silver gold PLA and plan you have to recognize where those boundaries are and you have to recognize well when
2:06:17
when I'm making myself vulnerable to someone and that's not working King and they're not they're not a receptive
2:06:23
they're not a receiver of that value they're not a Sor of that value it's just pouring into leaking bucket and to
2:06:30
shift the dynamic in a [ __ ] up way I have a very specific process that I understand what to shift that love and
2:06:37
that attention into and when I do I can Empower myself and I'll wish them the best and I'll love them but I can
2:06:42
Empower myself too okay does that make sense guys thank you very much I appreciate it
