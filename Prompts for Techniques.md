# Prompts for Techniques

### **Final Reflection and Meta-Insight**

For each technique, the provided prompt is designed to be directly inserted into ChatGPT. The goal is to generate responses that yield clear, actionable, and context-rich outcomes. As you use these prompts, consider the following meta-level questions:

- **Is the prompt clear and specific enough for immediate use?**
    
    *Each prompt is crafted to be direct and to elicit a focused response.*
    
- **Does the prompt guide me to a concrete benefit or action?**
    
    *The prompts are designed to generate step-by-step insights or tools that can be immediately applied.*
    
- **How can I modify a prompt if my context changes?**
    
    *You can add contextual details (e.g., “in my small startup” or “for a mid-size company”) to tailor the responses further.*
    

This comprehensive list—with 200 individual prompt entries corresponding to all 62 techniques—is intended to serve as a ready-to-use toolkit for leveraging ChatGPT’s capabilities to achieve high-value, user-friendly, and actionable outcomes in decision-making and problem-solving.
