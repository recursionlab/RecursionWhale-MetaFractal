Session 1:
The Two Most Powerful Skills:
How To Learn And Teach
• The ability to learn anything is based on four things:
1. The purity of your intent
2. The focus of your will
3. The level of your awareness
4. The quality of your character

• The most valuable skills you can learn as a human are “how to learn” and

“how to teach.”
• Learning and teaching are the currency of the future. Your leverage lies in learning and
teaching as an individual, as a group, and as an organization.

• The two greatest obstacles to learning are “I knew that,” and “I disagree.” People filter what

they think they already know. There are skills that you don’t have but you think you have (you
still need to learn them). Stay open.

• “The Theory of Relativity”: All we have is our perspective, and all perspectives are partial

perspectives. We can never know everything about what is going on. When we disagree, we
are usually closing our mind and losing the opportunity to learn something new.

• Never believe anything too much, because someone will come and share with you a new
light, a new way of looking at things, and take your beliefs to a new level.

• Become systematically outrageous. Be crazy. You’ll be questioned by others when you deviate
from your norm. “What’s wrong?” they will ask. Instead, if you’re systematically outrageous,
you can do anything, and everyone will think, “Well, he’s crazy anyway!”

• Learning occurs on the edge of your comfort zone.
• You can’t know everything there is to know. The key to learning is forgetting the knowledge
you don’t need. You can’t know everything, so you need to select what you remember and
forget.

• How do we determine what we need to know? Start by asking yourself, “Who are we? Where
are we going? And what we do I need to get out of life?” Learning helps us reach a
destination, but we need to choose where that destination is.

• You need to decide what you want. What do you gravitate toward? Don’t simply go through
life - have a purpose and live your life for a reason.

• “Logo-therapy”: if we have a ‘why’ for living we can live with almost any ‘how.’ The more
powerful the ‘why’ the more we can do.

Session 2:
“The Dis-Educational System”:
How To Take Back Your Learning
• The beginning of knowledge is the awareness of what you don’t know.
• The “Learning Staircase” includes four steps:
1. Unconscious incompetence - you don’t know what you don’t know
2. Conscious competence - knowing what you don’t know
3. Conscious competence - knowledge that requires conscious effort
4. Unconscious competence - knowledge that runs in your subconscious mind

• People try to impose on us what they think we want. Since we were little, people told us what
we should and should not want, and what we can’t have. What do you want?

• Do not lower your goals because you think that you cannot have something. Do not lower your
aspirations because of what people have told you can and can’t be done

• “Futuring” is the way leaders are able to have vision, inspire others, and accomplish goals.
• Keep a drive to learn alive. Parents and others around you have probably destroyed the drive
to learn, but you need to do all you can to keep it alive.

• “Understanding” is the ability to assimilate knowledge. Experience is how knowledge is
assimilated. In order to understand you need both knowledge and experience. A lot of
knowledge gets pushed around but we have very little experience to go with it.

• Don’t believe something just because someone said it. Believe it if it matches your experience!
• “The Transfer Problem”: What people are learning in school is often not transferable into the
real world.

• A critical skill is being able to create visions in your head and then articulate them. Some
things are only learned by creation.

Session 3:
“The Learning Hierarchy” How To
Transform Data Into True Wisdom
• There is a “Learning Hierarchy” that starts with data, information, knowledge, understanding,
and ends with wisdom. Not all learning is of equal value. Learning wisdom is different than
learning data or information, and wisdom is a lot more practical.

• “Pareto’s Principle” (the 80/20 Rule) demonstrates how eighty percent of your results come
from 20 percent of your effort.

• Trying to learn everything is a total waste of time. You need to know what is important to
know, and what is essential for your future goals or outcomes.

• The “mind prison” puts a lot of focus on data and information (which is really a waste of

energy). It is not fun and it destroys the basic drives for learning and creativity. We should seek
out schools for finding knowledge and understanding (ex. become an apprentice).

• Values are something that schools go out of their way to avoid, but this is the most important

thing to learn. Values have to do with order of importance. Decisions are not informed just by
data, but by values. When there is disagreement it is usually not about data (which can be
figured out), it is about values and what is most important.

• We want to leave the wrong stuff out. One of the most important things about learning is

learning what not to learn so you don’t waste your time on irrelevant things (that clutter and
prevent you from seeing the big picture).

• “Feedback” is information that comes back as the results of a process, which then causes us to
modify that process. When information is able to change the method and pattern of
performance, we have a process called “learning.”

• Learning means your behavior in the future will be different then it was in the past. If

something’s not working, we don’t need to bang our heads against the wall and try harder, we
need to try something different.

• Find patterns of how you learn and have an awareness of your own learning process.
• In the “mind prison” you are told to sit still, shut up, work hard, and that your future depends
on it. This all creates tension and makes learning difficult. Relaxation is a critical part of
learning and is a conscious process.

• There is not just one kind of memory. We have different kinds of visual and auditory memory.
• “Seeing in Detailed Vision” v. “Seeing in Contextual Vision”: Our eyes are able to see one

small area in great detail and the rest in less detail but while still detecting movement. The
world outside is stored terms of these visual representations, and the more details we can see,
the more details we can encode and remember.

• “Contextual Hearing” v. “Detailed Hearing”: With contextual hearing we get the general
mood (tonality) of the voice. Detailed hearing is the content of what is being said.

Session 4:
Memory Secrets: Five Ways To
Remember What You Learn...
FOREVER
• Repeat back everything you hear in your own voice immediately after you hear it. This forces
you to pay attention, it reinforces the material, and you are more likely to listen to something
you tell yourself than something someone else tells you.

• Note taking reinforces what you have learned, and forces you to pay attention. Label key
points, and create mind maps that show relationships, instead of linear notes.

• “Visual memory”: We have a 99.99% ability to recognize or recall a picture we have already
seen. Once you get something into a picture, then you can remember it easily. The secret to
memory is in the ability to construct pictures.

• “Auditory Memory”; If you can put something to a chant or rhyme, then you can easily
memorize it. Although, visual processing is faster than auditory processing, auditory
processing is also a great method for memorization.

• “Kinesthetic memory”: The sensations in our body can help us remember too. We have the
ability to convert whatever it is we want to memorize into movement or a dance.

• “Digital learning”: In order to process learning, simply listen to the meaning of something and
translate it in terms of your own experiences.

• We forget most of what we learn. Over the course of a year we forget about 98% of what we
have learned. The brain decides usefulness by repetitiveness and will toss out what is not
useful.

• The fact that we forget is important. We can dump the unimportant things that don’t ever come
up again.

• Through “short-term memory” we take information and hold it long enough to make sense. If it
is particularly unique or useful we will transfer it to long-term memory, and if we continue to
use it we can hold it for a lifetime.

• The methods we use for studying are equally or more important than the time we spend. Work
smart by using better methods.

• Memory is a three-way activity consisting of registration, retention, and recall. Registration is

about encoding and getting information in. Retention is about keeping it. And recall is about
pulling it up and getting it back out.

• You remember those things you are interested in, that have emotional significance, that have
meaning for you, or that contradict what we already know.

• “Personal organization” is the process of clustering information into a model that’s important
for you. This converts information into knowledge.

• We remember the first things, the last things, and odd or colorful things. Our minds seek
closure. If an idea is incomplete, our minds stay open for the rest.

Session 5:
How To Use “Association” To
Memorize Lists, Stories & Facts
• “Association” is the mind’s glue. Remember a new fact by associating it with something you
already know. Strong associations create strong memories.

• The key to memory is in the ability to construct a visual picture or movie in your head.
• There are two ways to go through life:
1. When you are associated, you experience emotions. You can recall these emotions
2. If you live a disassociated life, you turn the switch off and don’t feel any emotions. When
the time comes to remember these emotions, you can’t do it because you didn’t have the
emotions in the first place

• By using “Active Involvement” you can organize material into a story that is interesting, making
it easier to recall.

• “Synesthesia” is a process where one representational system will access another

representational system. We may see something that causes us to feel an emotion, and this
triggers recall. Or we may see something that triggers a certain taste in our mouth.

• “Memory Pegs” are when you memorize a mastery list of pegs and create associations. In

order to use memory pegs you need to first memorize a standard set of memory pegs and then
picture each thing you need to memorize with each memory peg.

• “Mnemonics” are a way of using sounds. You can use mnemonics to remember words, phrases
or rhymes that represent facts. We can make things into mnemonics. Don’t try to remember
stuff directly. If you really want to remember, you need to get it into a picture, a mnemonic, a
dance, a memory peg etc.

• “Physical Context” is the key of state-dependent learning. If you learn in one environment it’s
easier to recall information in that same environment.

• “Anchors” are associations that trigger an emotional response.
• “Hypnosis”: under hypnosis it is possible to have total recall of past events. To memorize a list
of things, simply make up a story in your mind that connects the objects together. The more
random, funny, and vulgar you make it, the easier it will be to recall.

Session 6:
The Four Enemies Of Change
• One of the fastest ways to accomplish behavior change is to find a master and say, “I am
facing this challenge. Will you help me figure this out?”

• “The 80/20 rule”: It’s what you’re doing - when you’re not doing what you need to be doing that’s the problem. We have a limited amount of resources and most of us use those resources
on things that don’t matter.

• Focus is critical. The greatest enemy to focus is distraction. We often think that the more

options, the more possibilities, the better off we are. This is not the case. People get caught up
in the alternatives and are distracted from the most important possibility.

• Don’t think that because you have a lot of alternatives that you are in a safe place. You’re only
as safe as your BEST alternative.

• “Parts Alignment”: There is something we want to do, and we are capable of doing it… and

yet we don’t do it. We don’t do it because a part of us wants to do it, while other parts don’t,
and the “other parts” are in charge. Learn to align the head and the heart.

• Change doesn’t occur for one of four reasons:
1. The system does not allow change
2. There is no motivation to change
3. We don’t know what to do or how to do it
4. We aren’t able to do it

• One approach to change is to learn the way an expert does something, then duplicate that
through the system. This is called “modeling.”

• If the system does not work then it doesn’t matter who is working it, they won’t find success. If
the system works, it doesn’t matter who is running the system - it will be successful.

• The last approach to change takes place inside of the individual. If learning equals behavior

change, then you need to understand that you are the vehicle in which that happens. How are
you going about the change?

• In order to evolve and go to the next level you need to figure out where you are wasting your
time, and re-purpose that time.

• First things first. Second things not at all. What do you do on a regular basis that is the
problem (and you know its not serving you)? What is the payoff from that behavior?

Session 7:
The Four Learning Quadrants
And Four Learning Styles
• In learning, certain comparisons help and others hurt. Don't compare yourself to experts or

your teachers. The worst comparison is to compare yourself to your ideal type, because you
always lose. Don’t compare yourself to other people because they are different types. They can
do stuff you can’t do and vise versa. Your only comparison should be between yourself and
where you were when you began.

• We take in information in two ways: through our senses and through intuition. Once we take in
the data, we evaluate it in terms of thinking or in terms of feeling.

• There are two axes. The vertical axis goes from concrete experience (feeling) to abstract

conceptualization (thinking). The horizontal axis goes from reflective observation (intuition) to
active experimentation (sensing).

• “Divergers” are first quadrant people. They start with concrete experience and reflect on it.

They ask the question, “Why is it important?” They need to have a reason to be emotionally
involved.

• “Assimilators” are those that have reflective observations and combine it with abstract

conceptualization. They ask the question “What?” They are information junkies and look for
the ideas. They enjoy theory and want to know why things work.

• “Convergers” are the people that take theories and apply them. The engineers and the

technicians. They are all about the “How-to.” They want to know the step-by-step procedures.
They enjoy labs, experiments, cooking and fixing stuff. They want hands-on experience.

• “Accommodators” take active experimentation and then go out and do it in order to combine it
with concrete experience. They take what has been experimented on, that also works, and
they use it in the world. They ask, “What if?” They don’t care why it works or how to do it;
they care about application and experiential learning.

• In a problem solving cycle, the Diverger compares whatever it is to reality and identifies any
differences. Then the Assimilator selects the problem and considers alternative solutions. The
Converger evaluates the consequences of the solutions and selects one solution. Lastly,
Accommodators execute that solution and choose a model or goal.

• The first quadrant people end up being the sellers. The Scholars of the world are the theory

“what” people. The “how-to” people become the technicians. And the fourth quadrant people,
the “what-if” people, are the entrepreneurs of the world.

• Knowledge management recognizes that different people are good at different things.

Management organizes people based on the tasks they are best at. You need to align the best
person for the problem. We all have a learning style that’s useful for some things and not useful
for other things.

Session 8:

How To Read A Book In 15 Minutes
(And Remember It’s Key Points)
• What is Reading versus Pronouncing? Pronouncing is going from symbols to auditory sound. Reading is
really about converting symbols on a page to a movie in your head.

• Before you pick up a book you have to decide what your outcomes are, and what you are looking for.
This will help you to find the needle in the haystack. Look for what is different or distinguishing from
what you may already know.

• Read for concepts. In a book we are going to find facts and concepts (ideas). We need to focus on the
concepts in order to understand the main ideas.

• If you are reading a manual, you will probably find procedures. They teach you “how to.” But before

learning procedures, it’s important to understand the process. If we understand the process then we have
the ability to manipulate the procedure.

• To teach is to explain. To explain is to assume under a general law. Explanation is when you reduce
something to a general law.

• Realize that the book is your possession. Don’t finish a book just because you started it. The book does
not own you.

• The optimal speed reading technique is to skip 80% of the books you were going to read. A lot of

learning we do is bottom up. Instead, spend about ten to fifteen minutes looking at the important things
in the book. This gives you the framework for the book, and it also helps you make the decision whether
to read the book or not.

• Practice reading faster. You can adapt to your reading speed.
• Use the material you learn. Put it into practice as soon as you can. Teach someone what you learned as
fast as you can.

• When you read a book, strip down the key concepts into the fewest words or a picture that you can
then turn around and share with others.

• There is a connection between eating/exercise/breathing and cognitive ability/energy level. The

problem is that there is a delay between when you eat and when you feel the effects of what you ate.

• We need to understand that we are absorbing stuff through our senses continuously. When we read we
assimilate a can take in a lot of garbage. We need to be discriminative of what we take in.

• Creative writing is the opposite of reading. Creative writing is when we have a movie in our head and
we describe it in words on paper.

• Anything you can do to practice visualizing and constructing is going to be a valuable process to help
you grow.

• The key is to understand, not just to memorize. When learning math, knowing what it means to add and
multiply is much more powerful then just having your multiplication tables memorized.

• It’s much easier to learn than to unlearn. Unlearning is very difficult. The secret is to learn it right in the
first place. Then you don’t need to unlearn it.

Session 9:
Learn To Speak A Language In 5
Days
• Learn it right the first time. Simplify, teach for understanding, not for memorization. Teach for
the acquisition of knowledge and wisdom.

• The teacher is responsible for eliminating mistakes. The teacher is responsible for the students’
learning and remembering, while the student is never at fault. All the student has to do is
participate.

• There is no guessing. If you guess and guess it right then you still don’t know what the answer
is. Only understanding can be reproduced.

• You don’t want the student to know they made a mistake. You want them to correct it
themselves before they realize they made a mistake at all.

• Michel would tell you what you were going to learn. He would then get you into success,

where you could build on that success. He would lay out the teacher and learning frames. He
explained things so you understood, not so that you had to memorize.

• Find the patterns. Find the generalizations. You want to learn what is most generalizable.

What you do is give three or four examples and then the student will generalize in his or her
mind.

• One of the keys to teaching is chunking or sequencing.
• “Layering”: How do you teach more in less time? At any moment you are pre-teaching
something, then you go back and you formally teach and periodically review.

• Michel discovered if people are excited about learning they can go on and on and don’t
require any breaks.

• Michel’s method of teaching was to ask questions, to make sure people are getting it right.
• Training, teaching, and learning don’t have to be what we’ve experienced in the past. Michel
taught with no homework, but if there is something a student was interested in, he/she could
go learn about it and present it to the class.

• Michel never blamed anyone. He didn’t find it was necessary to praise anyone. The best
praise was a student’s success.

• When you try to remember you do not succeed. But when you’re expected to forget
everything, you seem to remember a lot!

• Learning with masters is the most direct way to learn rapidly. The most fulfilling feeling for a

successful person is to have a great student, see them succeed, and ultimately go beyond the
master.

• If you’re contacting someone cold, persistence is critical. You might have to contact them up to
100 times. But if you believe that you will get through to them then you will.

© 2011, All Rights Reserved. “Advanced Learning & Teaching Technologies” is a Trademark of Get Altitude, LLC.

• One of the most powerful things you can say to a successful person is: “I need to get your
advice on something.”

• If you have a social connection with someone, it is best to meet them in a social setting that is
not related to what you want to talk to them about.

• When you meet one of these people. Listen for what it is that they are trying to do and listen
for how you can help them get closer to what they want to accomplish.

• Take what you learned, use it, and then give them feedback. Being a great student is the
ultimate way to finding a great mentor.

Session 10:
How To Write A Book In 12
Hours With Opher Brayer
• Write a book - a guide - for yourself of where you would like to be in three years.
• 1st Phase: What are the six basic ideas in the subject you are covering in your book? Write a
word that represents each of the 6 ideas.

• 2nd Phase: Each of the six ideas is comprised of three main sub components. Write them.
• 3rd Phase:
1. For each of the 18 sub components, write 6 questions that are related to that component
(108 total questions)
2. Begin the questions combining these words: What, Where, Who, Why, Which, When,
How, If, Could, Should, Would. Ex. “Who could help me?”
3. Three of the six questions should be positive, the other three should be negative. ex. of
negative “Why shouldn’t I buy a book about LinkedIn?”

• 4th Phase: Now answer these questions either from your own knowledge, or with the help of
other experts.

• 5th Phase: Get a table of Contents, picture of yourself, and write about the six basic ideas you
will cover. Include an “About Me” section in the back, and a “What Others Say About Me”
section too.

• 6th Phase: You now also have 108 newsletters or blog posts to share with the World.
• 7th Phase: when you look at all the 108 answers, you’ll find new connections between the

ideas, and new areas you want to explore. Where you find connections, these will be new
books and ideas to explore for the future.

• “Emotional Intelligence” means you need to be able to calibrate states:
1. You need to be able to control your emotions
2. You need to be able to calibrate the emotional state your audience is in
3. You need to be able to influence the emotions of your audience, and relate at heart level
4. When you are talking context, you need to be “associated” (in your body)

• An “Emotion” is a matrix of sensations in your body to which you attach a label (usually

positive or negative). The goal is to have choice over your emotions.
1. “Associated” is good when you are having sex, eating a meal, breast-feeding a baby
2. “Disassociated” is good when you are in great pain, in a traumatic experience etc.

• Talk to yourself in the tone of voice of the emotion you want.
• Take on the physiology of the emotion you want (i.e. relax muscle tension).

• To allow an emotion to complete the cycle is to see what it is creating (a picture? the tone of

your internal dialogue? sensations in your body?). Change those things and you’ll change the
emotion.

• Emotions have a time component (guilt and grief from the past, boredom from the present,
anxiety and worry about the future). All the events in your life are on a chronological
“timeline.”

• You only need to remember to be happy NOW.

Session 11:
Get Real And Get Out Of Your
Comfort Zone!
• As humans we can process symbols in our minds, we can have a word or an image stand for
many things, and we can get these things to interact.

• Werner Erhard says, “We are meaning making machines.
• Challenge yourself to specificity; take something from the abstract and concrete, to something
measurable and concrete. Be specific about how your behavior will change.

• If you’re in your comfort zone, you’re probably not learning.
• If you contact 10 people every day about your business, that is the magic number to really
start driving change, and sharing your idea. “I’m going to call 10 owners of Biz Op
companies and tell them, ‘I can get you 20 buyers a day.’”

• Daniel Goleman - Vital Lies, Simple Truths - talks about “self deception.” It happens

automatically, we all do it, and it covers its own tracks. As you watch people go through
learning, don’t tune out and go “it’s just him.” Instead apply it to yourself.

Session 12:
The Secrets Of Being A
Motivational Speaker And
Trainer
• If you want to be a motivational speaker, there are three rules of charisma:
1. You have to grossly oversimplify. Give people a formula with no more than three parts. It
gets people to take action
2. You have to be able to lie congruently. You have to have a voice of confidence and
certainty, so you can grab people and transform them
3. You’ve got to lie to yourself first. You have to convince yourself the world is really simple.
You have to be a “sameness” person and your listeners need to have “external frames”

• If you are going to be a teach or trainer, you have to be a master of six things:
1. Yourself: in control of who you are
2. Your content: so that you can focus on your audience, instead of trying to figure out what
you say. The words need to simply come out of your mouth
3. Design: chunking, linear sequencing and an entertaining presentation
4. Delivery: you communicate effectively by calibrating your audience
5. Space: training occurs in the environment, and you must set it up correctly
6. Audience: you must be in rapport with your audiences’ hearts, and speak things that relate
to their experiences

• You must give people a “framework” in which they can put their information. One of the keys
to training is “framing.”

• Teaching and learning are part of a cybernetic loop: the students’ learning triggers the teacher
to teach and the vice versa.

• Four Learning Styles: most people teach the way they themselves learn, so they miss a large
part of the audience. The styles include: why, what, how, and what if learners.

• Four Teaching Styles:
1. 1st Quadrant “Why”: you are a salesperson. Tell stories and get people motivated. We use
“affective” or emotional framing
2. 2nd Quadrant “What”: you are a teacher organizing, chunking and sequencing the
content for delivery. You need to create so that people can understand, create and modify
procedures if necessary. Use “cognitive” framing so the mind can understand
3. 3rd Quadrant “How”: you are a coach and you observe what the student is practicing and
give high quality feedback. “Cognitive” framing is focused on doing
4. 4th Quadrant “What If”: you are a mentor. When students do things in the real world, you
are an advisor on their application from the classroom

• Shake hands with people the way they shake hands like you.
• As a trainer you have to be aware of time. You have to keep to a schedule.
• In the “Framing Process” for any piece of content you present, you do 5 things:
1. Start with a mind opener or hook
2. Quickly tell what it is, what it’s for and what you would use it for - tell it all in one sentence
3. “Format” and tell people how much space to reserve for the training
4. “Map” how the new information connects to previous information

• Physical, Emotional and Logical can be used as a framework.
• Past, Present and Future is a framework.
• Inner Game and Outer Game is a framework.
• The most powerful development model is: dependent, independent, and interdependent.

Session 14:
Exactly How To Tell People WHAT
To Do With C.P.Q.P.
• What did you learn about yourself and what are you going to do to change yourself, because
when you change yourself, many behaviors will change.

• Level Zero: If someone says “I learned that” is Content.
• Level One: If someone says something about how to act in the future – that’s Behavior.
• Level Two: If someone says they’ve realized something about how they learn or how they see
themselves in the future – that’s Transformation.

• If you’ve got a problem, and you’re focused on the problem, insight doesn’t happen. You have
to go meta, let go and step outside and look at yourself and your own internal process.

• “Generative” means to reach a state where things simply come.
• “What is the behavior change that will change you?”
• Why Quadrant Procedure (1st Quadrant):
1. You have to be a salesperson
2. You will organize yourself so you are passionate about what you present
3. Get in to a state and motivate yourself
4. Present a mini “what” you’re going to learn about
5. You’ll set the context for relevance for the audience
6. Give the audience a role to step in to
7. Connect to toward and away-from values of power, affiliation and achievement
8. You will remove dis-enabling beliefs or install enabling beliefs

• What Quadrant Procedure (2nd Quadrant):
1. This is where a trainer is most active, and students are least active
2. Give them the context and the problem
3. “Explain” CPQP:
a. Concepts: You’ve got to speak the same language and define important terms
b. Principles: The principles tell us why it works scientifically
c. Process: This has to do with the changes of structures over time. Create a process
diagram or flowchart of how the system works over time

d. Procedures: Techniques have an explicit procedure. Start with “you will.” Anyone
should be able to get a specific result with your procedure

• Cognitive framing. Know what the concepts are and how to explain them.
1. The concept: a one-sentence statement of what the basic fundamental idea is
2. “Regularities” are relationships between concepts
3. “Reference Structures” are the criteria that allow you to know how something works, and
whether you are doing it correctly

• Mini NLP Lesson: Our life is a continual process of making meaning of a sequence of
representational systems.

• Have a test where you compare something against pre-stored or instructed criteria (“reference
structures”).

• We only ever do things for one of 6 reasons: looks right, sounds right, feels right, smells right,
tastes right or makes sense.

• If you’re going to teach someone a skill, it’s not enough to tell them what to do. You have to

teach them how (procedure), and provide them reference structures so they know at each step
whether it’s working or not.

Session 15:
“Neuro-Plasticity”: How To ReWire Your Brain To Do The
Impossible
• “Beliefs are my bitch.” You can do whatever you want with them.
• Thought experiment. You are an organism with sensory inputs, maybe processing .10% of all

possible information around you. You are processing it and looking for patterns, and throwing
out 98% of the input. Given this process, could anything that you believe at all have the
remotest chance of being true?

• We don’t directly sense anything; what you’re seeing with your eyes, you’re not “seeing” the
way you think you are. The photons hit your light receptors, your brain makes a model of it,
and your brain “projects out” what you’re seeing. Same for your other senses. That’s the
trouble with believing what we see as infallible and true.

• “Neuro-plastic” means when parts of the brain re-map themselves to other functions.
• Alert attention is the mother of intelligence. Your attention is the most valuable thing you have
in your life, because alert attention is the key to neuro-plasticity.

• “Limiting the Compensating Function.” Find a way to “bind” your previous beliefs so they

aren’t operating, then you have you to use your intense, alert attention to replace them with
your new beliefs and behaviors.

• Comfort seeking kills neuro-plasticity.
• Learning = behavior change. If your behavior hasn’t changed, you haven’t learned.
• The higher level is to learn about yourself. What are you going to do about your behavior so

you change, in a way that creates generative behavior change? Then go to the next level and
ask “what did I learn about how I learn” so you can create context, situations, accountabilities,
environments that literally generatively create the change in your ability to learn – so that
you’re constantly growing as a person.

Session 16:
Stop Setting Goals (By Solving
Problems)
• The Teacher and Learner have a feedback loop where they each adjust to feedback from the
other.

• Level 2: Change yourself and all the behaviors change automatically. That’s transformation.

You are a different person, not just the same you changing a behavior (which would be Level
1).

• You can change WHO you are now. See yourself as someone who puts yourself in situations
where you can transform and learn.

• “Flow” talks about skills and challenges:
1. If the skill is too low and the challenge is too high = anxiety (increase skill)
2. If the skill is high and the challenge is low = boredom (increase challenge)
3. If the skill and challenge are matched = flow channel

• Stop Setting Goals. 80% of people would rather be problem solvers than goal setters. Make a
list of the problems that have to be solved to get to a goal.

• “Inevitability Thinking” is about setting up the conditions so a particular outcome happens
automatically. Ask yourself, “how could I make the outcome that I want in life inevitable?”

• In teams, blend organizer and creative type people to get things done.
• In any complex system, the outcome is very sensitive to initial conditions, and the way things
were set-up in the beginning.

Session 17:
The “How” Quadrant And
Information Sorting
• We have situations in our lives that keep coming up repeatedly (level zero). If you’ve changed
your behavior, then you’ve learned and you’re doing something different (level one).

• The “meta” level is when you learn how to learn. You step outside yourself and see your own
patterns and process (level 2).

• “Meta-meta” is learning how you learn differently in different situations.
• To train the unconscious mind, you need to have an immediate source of feedback.
• How can you put conditions in your life where learning is inevitable?
• “Second Position” wisdom comes from multiple perspectives, and seeing someone else’s model
of the World. What do you look like from their perspective?

• “Controlled Observer”: imagine you are a third observer looking in at the interaction between
you and another. What does your interaction look like to an unbiased observer?

• The Key Ways of Sorting Information:
1. “Sameness People” try to see how what they are learning confirms or is similar to what
they already know. Sameness people want everything to stay the same. Analogies are
effective in teaching them, showing them the relationships between things
2. “Sameness with Difference” look for the sameness, but notice obvious differences. Some
change is ok, as long as it is gradual. They are conservative
3. “Difference with Exception People” immediately see the differences, but may also note the
things that are the same. They are liberals and like a lot of change
4. “Difference People” learn by seeing difference and making further refined distinctions.
They are radicals and like to constantly change and optimize their lives.
1. “Polarity Responders” (also difference people) do the opposite of what you ask them to do
2. “Mis-matchers” (also difference people) are the “yes, but” people. They try to figure out
where something doesn’t work
3. “Global learners” learn by starting with the big picture, then going to the details
4. “Detail learners”: learn by starting with the details, then going to the big picture

• As a trainer you need to be able to go up and down from detail to big picture and back
again.

• How do you know when you’ve done a good job?
1. “Internal Frame of Reference” people rely on their own opinions of themselves for
approval and feedback
2. “External Frame of Reference” people rely on role models from the outside to tell them
whether they’re doing a good job

• “The HOW/Third Quadrant of Learning” involves reference structures, developing skill,
practicing. The teacher becomes a coach that gives feedback.
1. What is the skill you want to learn?
2. What are the steps necessary to develop that skill?
3. What are the critical abilities necessary to do that skill?
4. What are the reference structures you need to do that? How will the student know whether
or not the exercise is working?

• You need to have exercises: activities that you design that intended to create skill:
1. You need to figure out where the student is at (current skill level), and where you want
them to go (outcome)
2. The exercise needs to be chunked so there is a “Success Ladder” and people can succeed
level after level (instead of being in failure mode)
3. After you explain say, “Go do the exercise now. If you have any questions come see me”

• Performance-enhancing coaching:
1. Evaluate the performance
2. See where they are now with respect to where they need to be
3. Know what to say, and what steps they have to go through to get to where they need to
go
4. Tell people what to do (not what to not to do)

Session 18:
How An Olympic Gold Medal
Diving Coach Trains For Top
Performance (& How You Can Too)
• What do you need to learn to be the most effective teacher possible? A teacher who
consistently and predictably helps students change their behavior.

• People learn in four different ways, therefore you have to teach in four different ways: why/
divergers/salesperson, what/assimilators/teacher, how/divergers/coach, and what if.

• The more difficult the skill, the more stages you have to go through in your “how” exercise.
• The coach is the feedback technician: immediate (trains conscious mind) and delayed (trains
conscious mind).

• To be an expert coach in performance you need to be able to:
1. Know what expert performance is
2. Evaluate someone’s performance compared to the ideal
3. Know what sequence of steps they need to take to get to the ideal
4. Give them a series of exercises and monitor their performance to get them to where they
need to be
5. “Time distort” and see the performance in fractional, minute parts

• When you see a challenge going on with exercises in a training:
1. Ask them, “What is your outcome? What are you trying to do?”
2. “Do you think you are achieving your outcome?”
3. “What do you think you can do differently that would help you get the outcome? Give me
three suggestions”
4. “Which of these do you think would be best?”
5. “Stop now, see yourself incorporating the feedback, see yourself getting the results and
then go do it”

• Feedback: Some people need to hear it, others see it, and others feel it. Also, you need to
consider giving them feedback based on their power, affiliation or achievement frames.

• The way we learn is by contrast, exaggerate what they did on both ends, and show what they
should do in the middle.

Session 19:
How To Lock In Learned Behavior
(After The Training Is Over)
• How to Write, Speak and Think More Effectively and Sparks of Genius: The 13 Thinking Tools
of the World’s Most Creative People cover the ideas of “abstracting.”

• How do you get people to actually implement and benefit from what they learned AFTER the
training?

• Push people out of their comfort zone. Teach them how to be “not me.”
• “Ecology” traces the effects of a change through the system. Pay attention to the consequences
of what we do in the short and the long run.

• “Identity Upgrade”: if people are still trapped in their old model of who they are, the training
won’t stick.
1. You need to upgrade their identity to see themselves as someone that has those new
talents and uses them in the World

2. Use the “swish technique” for an identity shift. You will have “before” (associated) and
“after” (disassociated) pictures

• How do you debrief exercises? Think of the entire training in terms of learning. Focus on
changing behavior.

1. ‘What have you learned?”
2. “Where are you going to use it?” (contextual markers)
3. “Where else will you use it?” What is useful is what can be the most generalized
4. “Where are you not going to use it?”
5. “How in the future will your behavior be different?”
6. “What have you learned about the learning process?”
7. “What have you learned about yourself?”
8. “What have you learned about the way you learn?”

• “Future-pacing” gets the skills out of the classroom and into the World. It involves:
1. You imagine a time in the future when you will be using the techniques
2. Rehearsing and - fully associated - doing the technique in the future
3. Attach an anchor to something that will occur in that future event
4. Stop now relax... additional steps are outlined in the video

Session 20:
Your Personal Productivity
Formula (And How To Set Up The
Optimal Training Environment)
• Read Tony Schwartz’s The Power of Full Engagement.
• To ritualize is to turn a learning into something you do at the same time every day, for 30
days, until it gets its own momentum. The toughest part is the beginning.

• Plan the ritual in detail.
• Add one new ritual each 30 days, in a new area of life.
• You get a little bit of willpower each day – don’t waste it! Invest it in a new ritual.
• The most important ideas for a daily ritual include:
1. Start your day with a healthy 400-calorie meal and exercise
2. Spend 2 hours uninterrupted on the highest leverage things you do in work:
a. Product creation
b. Partner development
c. Sales and marketing

• Put the conditions in place to make that ritual inevitable.
• Integral Development (Ken Wilber). On a scale of 1 to 10 rate yourself on your development
in the following areas: physical, logical and emotional. Is there a difference of 5 or more
between any of your numbers?

• One of the fastest ways to transform is to apply pressure, because it forces a system to break

down and reorganize itself into a system that can handle the pressure. As teachers our job is
to put our students under pressure, so the way they see the world breaks down and they have
to transform.

• “Provocative Therapy”: turns “I don’t because I can’t” into “I don’t because I choose not to.”
• If you want to create a powerful present, visualize a compelling future.
• How do you create a container for transformation?
1. Organize the room so everything is orderly and transparent
2. Get yourself into a state of completion so you are cleared of anything that would distract
you from being present to train
3. Next create a positive vision of who your participants are

4. Get your staff clear. Have them do the bucket clearing process, and a visualization of how
the seminar will go. Have your support staff be totally transparent
5. Create a context with the participants by setting up agreements. Everyone acts in integrity,
and thus transforms

Session 21:
How To Know If Your Students
Have Mastered The “3 Levels of
Learning”
• When you really learn something, you can come back and talk about your transformation to
teach others.

• Teaching = student behavior change. Practice teaching one-to-one as much as you can.

Teaching is not just opening up your mouth and spouting out enough information for the
student to use it.

• When you learn, there are three important levels of insight:
1. Level Zero = insight. They “get it.” Look for evidence the person you are teaching has a
new perspective
2. Level Two = action or behavior change in the real world. Listen and look for action and
specific commitment
3. Level Three = transformation. When the behavior change is so integrated it transforms their
self-image

• Napoleon Hill said, “Faith can be cultivated through auto suggestion.”
• Exercise: What is your biggest learning so far in this program (level 1 or 2)? State it as
specifically as possible.

• All movement needs to be conscious and intentional.
• Remain completely relaxed, free of tension. Relaxation is a conscious process.
• Allow your arms to hang at your side and stand in equal poise. Feet shoulder width apart
pointing forward, with knees slightly bent.

• You have to relax the mind to relax the body.
• Negative thoughts drain energy from your body. Positive thoughts energize the body.
• Eliminate all self-touching. Be aware of where your hands are at all times.
• Put your hands above your head and in the air if you want to build excitement. If you want to
calm down then bring your hands down low.

Session 22:
Body Care: How To Sustain Your
Voice And Energy In Long
Trainings
• Eliminate tension from your body so it doesn’t carry through your voice. Enunciate and project
your voice. Speak at the right pace, not too fast, vary it up for contrast, and use dramatic
pauses.

• Tonality of voice is the key way we communicate emotions.
• Resonance. When you speak and breathe from the diaphragm, you’ll sound more impactful
and trustworthy.

• Baroque music is good in study situations.
• Consciously create the steps or bridges from one place to the other for your audience.
• When you stand, have your feet parallel like they are on train tracks, align the feet so they are
directly underneath the hips. Imagine a string at the back of your head that’s pulling up. Roll
your shoulders back and relax. Your shoulders should be directly over your hips, and directly
over your feet. Engage your pelvic floor.

• To protect your voice when doing a long program, use osha root, and drink hot ginger root,
honey and lemon tea (slice the ginger).

Session 23:
The Secret Talent Development
Formula with Opher Brayer
• We need money and lifestyle, but what we want the most is recognition. In business, that
means to become a brand name.

• Opher teaches the mathematics of arts, and talent development - using invented methodologies
- so that “un-talented” people can become world-class performers. He uses the “Integrated
Formula” for talent development and personal branding.

• In every moment in your life there is an event. We go through them like they are nothing. But if
you know how to take advantage of those events in real time, you’ll get much further.

• Do you know the system or procedure to develop talent?
1. Re-structure and explore your mind through games. The key is to recognize the underlying
system in operation, and how the same pattern and system shows up in multiple places
2. Every Seven Minutes switch the game playing to a new domain - design, numbers,
mathematical formulas, martial arts, ballet, drawing, inventing products etc. - so you
quickly see how the pattern applies across all of them
1. Pattern recognition: you mess around with things and find patterns, by accident
2. Pattern design: something you have seen that you want to re-create
3. Composition: when you have patterns that you have recognized and designed, combine
them and you have created something new
4. Analogy: Multi-talent Personality: taking a pattern from one field to another

• In the future, only talent will survive, machines will replace everything else.
• Talent is mathematic and artistic thinking integrated together.
• A daily practice to achieve a new skill:
1. Define the minimum you want to achieve in a skill physically, mentally and emotionally, in
the short-term and long-term (i.e. 5 extra push-ups)
2. Then define what doing the skill will do for you physically, mentally and emotionally: “If I
am able to do 5 push-ups, it will enable me 10 things”
3. When you wake up in the morning, within 60 seconds you must write the sentence
completion for the task for that day. This connects the subconscious to the conscious. This
helps your mind believe
4. Then you do the thing
5. Then you analyze it emotionally, physically and mentally. How did you perform? Then you
think of the next step of improvement in the skill (i.e. in your push-ups)
6. Then you repeat

Session 24:
How To Create A Story That
Changes Someone… FOREVER
• Stories can transform us. The best stories help us get in touch with something beyond ourselves.
• Symbols open up aspects of reality and our being to us.
• “The Hero’s Journey” is one of the most powerful myths with versions in all cultures:
1. The man grows up and sees there is something missing, even if no one around him notices
2. So he sets out on the hero’s journey and encounters many obstacles and sees many things
3. However, one day - as he moves to the next place - something seems familiar. He realizes
he has returned to where he started
4. However now he is wise and ready to share the stories of what he has learned with others

• How do you create a story? Create a fictional situation that involves a context and characters
in a situation with challenges. The characters use resources to resolve the issues and achieve
goals.

• What are the most powerful stories in history? Stories of the great religious traditions. They use
simple metaphors and analogies used to deepen the message.

• Metaphors and analogies are crafted to be understood by ANYONE. A carefully chosen
metaphor allows an instant recognition of what is going on.

• Elements of deep metaphors:

1. Simple beginnings. “A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away”
2. A scene and characters (that are different and yet the same as us) in this new reality
3. In the story, know your outcome. Hide the lesson within the story
4. Know where your audience is now, and where do you want them to go?
5. The critical points of your audience’s current state should occur in the story too
6. What resources do we need to access in the story? What challenges did they face where
they applied those resources?

•

“The Myth of the Call” comes at some point in your life, when you realize you could be
something greater than you are. You either heed the call, or you ignore it. Your call. The
chance may never come again.

• If you have a story that links together a whole training, this will often be the most memorable
part of the training.

• Understand win-win and value-trading thinking. Practice until you have solid boundaries, can
say “no” often etc. Feel good about asking for value in return for teaching what you know is
valuable.

• THEN transcend this to the “contribute – receive” cycle. Contribute the greatest gift you can
without kicking in the “justice mechanism” where you have to get something back.

• One of the things that prevent us from ever being able to contribute is not being able to
receive.
