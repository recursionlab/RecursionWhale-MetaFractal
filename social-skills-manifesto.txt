- I've been working on myself since 2006, okay? I'm originally from Switzerland, the French part of Switzerland.
0:07
Started out extremely shy, that's back in 2006, 15 years ago and I've been on this 15-year journey
0:13
of really improving at first, my social skills and then all areas of life. And since 2010, I've been traveling around the world
0:20
teaching this to people just like yourselves, where my typical week prior to this whole situation that we're in
0:28
was every single week, I'm in a new country, flying into a new city. I arrive, I'm doing an event on Thursday,
0:35
usually a free event then working with clients at night after that. Friday, working all day, all night.
0:40
Saturday, Sunday, more events and then it's off to the next city and that has been my life for again, a decade, okay?
0:48
Literally traveling around, seen tens of thousands of people face-to-face, millions online if you count social media and YouTube
0:56
and it's reached a point where I've seen it all, okay? When it comes to true transformation and this is something that seems to be forgotten nowadays
1:04
is it's 2021. And if you go on social media, you go on YouTube,
1:09
everyone and their mom is a coach, right? Everyone and their mom and they have a few clients and I think that's cool, I think it's great, okay?
1:16
I support anyone who wants to be of service, who wants to be a coach. However, what we tend to forget is in order to be a coach,
1:23
you do need to have certain reference experiences in terms of how many people you've actually coached.
1:29
You can't say you're a coach if you have say, one client or two, okay? You need a ton of references, that's my job.
1:36
Since 2010, tens of thousands of references, face-to-face like this. No matter who you are, what you're dealing with,
1:42
being very modest, I've seen it before and I've dealt with it before. This used to be me, okay?
1:48
This is me back, again, in my early days, some of those photos were actually a couple of years in
1:54
already working on myself. And like I've said, if I really wanna describe to you the mindset that used to live in,
2:00
perhaps this was you, perhaps this is you, I was extremely shy and stifled
2:05
since as far as I can remember, since I was a kid, right? Since probably the age of five, six at school,
2:11
suddenly something happened and I decided to just clam up and I got so socially shy and awkward
2:18
that I even experienced social anxiety around family members. Everyone's like, well,
2:24
I'm kind of scared to go say hi to someone new. I was scared for a holiday, a family gathering when, oh, the cousins and the aunts
2:30
and grandparents, everyone's coming, that would give me anxiety. People are looking forward to the holidays, not me, okay?
2:36
Same at school, same later on in again, high school, university, extremely shy.
2:42
That was the reality that I lived in. I would not, and this is why I also wanna give everyone here some props,
2:48
I would not have made it out to an event like this, especially nowadays with everything going on. Even if this event was right outside my house,
2:54
say back in Switzerland, I would be way too scared to even walk outside the door and show up in person, because I would be thinking
3:00
everyone in this crowd is now judging me, staring at me, oh, where do I stand? I'd be sitting in the back, probably in the shadows, scared,
3:05
and as soon as perhaps the speaker would stare in my direction, I would look down or hide under the table, it was that bad.
3:11
And I know this can be a little hard to believe 'cause you see the videos now, and you're like, okay, that's cool, what can I learn?
3:16
But I really wanna show you this to hammer the point home that it's possible.
3:23
And this is huge, this is the foundation when it comes to true personal transformation. You have to truly deep down inside, gun to the head,
3:30
what's the truth? Believe that you can do it. And I can guarantee you because you're here,
3:36
there's definitely a part of you that believes. However, this is what I've noticed in so many clients, you believe that you can only change a little bit.
3:43
You'll see some people do like a full 180 and you're like, whoa, that's crazy and inspiring. But on your end, you're like, well, if I do the same thing as that person,
3:50
maybe I'll get a 10% result and there's not that true belief that you can become, again,
3:55
that dream ideal version of yourself. And if you don't believe it, it doesn't matter what you hear here today,
4:02
it doesn't matter what content or what routines or what techniques you add to your life, you're not gonna change
4:07
more than what you actually believe. So, I'm gonna show you here at first and we're gonna be going really deep,
4:12
think of this whole speech here as this odyssey diving into, again, my journeys things I've seen in clients,
4:18
how things have evolved, epiphanies I've had, take this with you, but it all starts with the earlier days, okay?
4:25
That used to be me, and if you see this and in your mind, you're thinking, wow, I'm a little bit better than that? Good, if you're a little bit better than that,
4:32
if you put the work in, you, if you perhaps look up to me here, should be better than me, okay?
4:40
So, I went from that to living my dream life, okay? No joke, in Switzerland, again, when I was shy,
4:47
I would lie in bed and I think about all the cool things like, oh, if I could have cool friends, if I could travel, if I could have different relationships,
4:52
if I could meet someone, if I could do all these cool things, ah, but I'm stuck in Switzerland. This is the stuff I would dream of and fantasize about
4:58
every single day, every single night and it made, it happened, okay?
5:04
Life of my dreams and I've taught it to once more, thousands of clients. This used to be me a little bit more.
5:12
My favorite photo, if you've been following, by the way, some of my YouTube lives is the cactus photo.
5:18
Literally, I think that photo is just the most classic photo of all time. I will keep showing this photo till the day I die.
5:23
I'm like, that used to be me. And I don't know how I thought at the time
5:29
that was a good idea. I'm like, whoa, see this cactus, if I just stood next to it, that'd be the cool, it just. (audience laughing)
5:35
Okay, that used to be me, too, okay? Up here in the corner with the cap, that's when I first moved to Los Angeles, all right?
5:41
Then somehow decided it cool to dye my hair. On the very right, that was in Phoenix
5:46
when I first started going out and working on my social skills with the oversize white jacket and this weird necklace
5:53
and literally in that photo, I thought I was so cool, by the way, that's a few years in already working on myself. I thought I was so cool, I was like, I got this handled.
6:00
If you see that, and you're like, wow, I'm a little bit better off, good. 'Cause that's a few years inner me
6:06
already working on myself intensively, okay? And then of course at the bottom, Jeff's good old van, okay?
6:15
That's my background. I also was very child-like when I started out
6:22
and very destructive during a certain period of time, okay? The video I'm gonna crack into here, this is a short one,
6:28
this is in San Francisco in a taxi cab with Owen and I'd gone out the night before
6:34
and I was drinking at the time, drank way too much and he filmed this the next day. And while filming this, we talked about it after it's like,
6:40
you will want to cherish this footage, you'll be able to show the transformation, dah, dah, dah, and in the moment, I'm just some kid I'm like, I guess so,
6:45
okay, and here I am showing it, okay? So, this year was where I was at a few years in.
6:51
You're gonna see the type of mentality, it's like, oh, that literally looks and sounds like a dumb kid.
6:57
Notice once more the change and put yourself there in the same shoes, like, are you further along than that?
7:02
And if so, you can do so much better. If that kid can turn into this, okay?
7:09
That little caterpillar can turn into a butterfly, so can you. - [Man] How do you feel right now?
7:14
- Pretty good, well, if I drink monster, I'd feel pretty really good.
7:20
But fortunately I'm forced to live off vitamins, which doesn't help.
7:28
Monster win. - [Man] Beast mode tonight. Beast mode.
7:33
- Never again the beast could be unleashed.
7:40
Dude, you're making me laugh, I feel like (indistinct). A bit of laughing, a bit of talking.
7:46
- Beast mode. I'll be out beasting sleeping on my couch.
7:54
- This is me starting to travel with Owen, helping them out on different events.
8:00
That's my background. Gets worse. - You can see it has like, strange rust stains on the front.
8:08
And actually, yo, what's that? Like, trash, body factory.
8:19
What do you have to say for yourself? That's what you had to say for yourself?
8:24
A random metal bar.
8:32
What do you guys think? Yo, whoever can guess correctly what this metal bar is for
8:39
will get, I don't know a personal email from Julian.
8:47
- I'm like 100, (indistinct).
8:56
- I literally thought it looked so cool by the way, I'd wear that all the time and I thought it was like, a hunter and literally walked around thinking I was a hunter.
9:04
Now, okay? That's the backgrounds, okay? And it's so key, by the way, there's more of this,
9:10
but we always send to compare ourselves with people where there are now, and we're like, oh, how could I ever be that or do this?
9:15
And everyone does this by the way. But you gotta train yourself to look behind the scenes, okay? You right now, if you're just starting out
9:22
or even just a few years in, that's probably where you're at
9:27
and think of the potential of what you could actually become. It's 100% possible, okay?
9:33
No one's cut from a different cloth. What one person can do, another person can do, we even look at people who are like say more successful,
9:39
and we're like, how do they do it, right? Or how are they so disciplined? It's like, you can do that, too.
9:44
And you really gotta believe it and let go of any kind of limitations that tell you maybe it's different for you, okay?
9:52
Now, this year was just in terms of the vibe, starting out. Also, when I started working and say recording myself
9:58
or doing seminars, I was so shy stifled, I almost wasn't able to and I almost wasn't fully hired because of it.
10:05
There was a moment, no joke where Owen sat me down, again, I was traveling around helping him,
10:11
those videos there. And he's like, okay, let's start recording some actual vblogs, okay? let's go on YouTube, social media is gonna be this thing,
10:17
let's put videos out there and I could not talk in front of a camera.
10:23
The camera, and the fact that I knew people would see it triggered the exact same anxiety
10:29
that I'd been working on overcoming for the past few years. But it was amplified, right? 'Cause there's a certain executive, you're like, okay,
10:34
if I just go talk to someone, I'm a little anxious, but you can kind of work through that, and then it's like, oh, I'm gonna do this, and it determines your career, your life
10:40
and hundreds or thousands of people or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands are gonna see it, don't mess it up, go.
10:47
And they're just staring at this thing that's a camera, and you're like, there's no reaction, I can't read it, am I doing good?
10:52
Couldn't, okay? This was one of the first attempts, I'd created this little blog back then, it was called julianlife.com
10:59
and I'm like, okay, I just need to record, no joke, this is it, a 30 second welcome video where you just arrive on the site, you see me,
11:06
and I'm like, hey, I'm Julian working with Owen, if you wanna hear some cool updates, enjoy, that's it.
11:12
This is what happened. - Yeah?
11:19
This is Julian, welcome to my blog. I'm here in Los Angeles right now on the rooftop of my apartment
11:25
as you can tell by the view in the background, and I wanna share with you here some of my ideas,
11:31
experiences, anything that has been working for me and that'll hopefully help you out as well.
11:37
So, check the blog, I'll be updating it regularly every Tuesday and Thursday and I hope you enjoy.
11:44
One more take, one more take. So, check the blog, I'll be updating it regularly with, ah.
11:54
This is Julian, welcome to my blog. I'm here in Los Angeles right now on the rooftop of my,
12:01
this is Julian, welcome to my blog. I'm here in Los Angeles right now on the rooftop of my apartment
12:08
as you can tell by the view in the background. - Tried on the rooftop and then I'm like, okay, time to do an actual vblog.
12:14
And the first time I tried with San Francisco, way too scared to do it, I set up the camera, people were staring, couldn't do it.
12:20
Then went on this mini European tour where I did Copenhagen, Stockholm, and then Prague
12:26
and I tried recording this, this is my very first vblog and all those cities couldn't in San Francisco,
12:32
couldn't in Copenhagen, couldn't in Sweden. This is gonna be the Swedish attempt. But and finally I could in Prague
12:38
and if you've been following me for a long time, that was the very first video I ever put out and it was called the moment of realness, okay?
12:45
So, this is me trying to do this moment of realness. Show up, set up, this is in Sweden. Camera's on, way too shy, way too scared.
12:52
Okay, what up? Hi, okay, let me get in soon, this is Julian, this is Julian.
12:59
And wanna talk about some of the basic, ah, this is so weird. Couldn't do it.
13:05
And again, just staring there, it's like people walking by, I'd be all quiet, I'm like we got to do it again, another take and would just fail, okay?
13:13
And then some other last little attempt here. That was perfect.
13:19
I don't wanna be in this video. I'm like, using a shtick versus just being yourself and especially being filmed,
13:24
you yourself move things forward and being yourself integrity instead of using the shtick and moving things forward,
13:32
just sobbing your batteries. - Yeah. - So, same thing, couldn't even look into the camera, stuttering a bit, right? It's like, oh, in this like wavering,
13:39
that's where I come from. And this here is already 10 times better than my earlier days.
13:46
This is like 2010, 11, that's already four years in working on myself, okay?
13:52
Not to put a leg at negative label, I wasn't the most hard case person I've seen, but I was definitely a hard case newbie,
13:58
but I did have some things going for me that allowed me to move up and surpass people who were even a bit ahead of me
14:04
when I first started, okay? So, there we go for the clips
14:10
and I hope you're a clap friendly as those. (audience applauding) Now.
14:17
So, let's get into some of the concepts here, okay? The first one and you can sense it from these clips
14:24
and even if you've been following me after that, some of the other videos I put on the few years after, the frame overall is very competitive,
14:32
this is huge, okay? These clips here, the whole theme is I'm in a very competitive state
14:38
where here I am, and it's me versus whoever's gonna watch this video
14:44
where I immediately assume that people are out to get me, people are judging me, people are criticizing me,
14:50
people are going to something very negative in me unless I prove them wrong.
14:55
And it's this whole battle, me versus. It would happen even back in the day on stage, I'd go in front of a crowd like this
15:01
and it said to me like, okay, how's it going? Welcome, everyone, I would be preparing at the back like, okay, must conquer, must dominate.
15:08
They all hate me, they're all gonna think I'm not good enough unless I prove them wrong and I'd go up and it'd just be this very forced tonality, okay?
15:16
You can optimize this paradigm and that's what I did at first. It was me versus same worry, same insecurities,
15:21
but I'd be battling against it, okay? Can anyone relate so far by the way? Raise your hand if so, right?
15:27
Or you can also test yourself, if you walk into a new venue, right? Say you go out, you wanna meet someone, you walk into a venue, how would you experience it?
15:34
For a lot of people, it's you walk in and suddenly (gasps), right? Your heart starts beating, you start looking around, you're like, are people staring?
15:40
Where do I stand? Do I fit in? What's okay? Oh, maybe I should go over there, who should I say hi to? And it's you versus, it's this very hostile environment,
15:47
this very scary environment, right? And then from that place, what do people do?
15:53
They try to work on their social skills, right? They try to get out of their head, they try to stop worrying. They try to build momentum, so on and so forth,
16:00
but they're still in that competitive state as opposed to, and you can achieve this, walking into a venue
16:06
and instead of that immediate, oh, me versus, it's everyone's on my side, hey, how's it going?
16:12
And just completely at ease, okay? That there, that collaborative state
16:17
is where you want to move towards. And you've all had glimpses of it, right? It's crazy, too, let me know if you having this experience,
16:25
you go out and at first it's very competitive, you're like, oh my God, it's such a scary environment, so you take some action maybe 30 minutes later,
16:32
maybe an hour later. So, you get in state, you're in the zone, same environment, but suddenly you see it completely differently now.
16:39
Suddenly you're having fun, you're looking around and it's like, everyone's my friend 'cause you got yourself in that other state, anyone experienced that?
16:45
same environment that was so scary at first, later on, you feel comfortable in it, right? Shifting from competitive to collaborative
16:53
and we're gonna go deeper on that, but that is definitely the theme here. Now, the other one that I mentioned is I kept going, okay?
17:00
There's a few things, especially, this is for those of you who are starting out that you really need to get in check.
17:05
Number one, be selfish. Meaning want this for you? That's something I had.
17:12
And this is something funny enough with social media that less and less people have where you see, for example, someone on YouTube,
17:17
someone on Instagram, someone you might be like, oh, I wanna learn that, I wanna learn from that person, I wanna be like that.
17:22
And instead of taking that and applying it, you just end up worshiping that person, right?
17:29
Oh, let me learn more about this, let me see them more, oh, let's see what they're doing. Other people, other people. And you never take it and apply it to yourself.
17:35
For me, yeah, I look up to other people, I'm inspired by other people, but I always take what I'm learning and I apply it to me.
17:43
You gotta be selfish, it's like, no, no, no, I'm not using all this as another kind of fantasy watching this cool movie,
17:50
it's I'm gonna do it so my life becomes the movie. And once more, you also gotta believe that's possible.
17:56
If you're like, well, maybe my life could be a little bit better, but it won't be as cool as that person's movie, BS. No matter who you look up to,
18:03
you can live just as epic of a life. If you applied, if you're selfish.
18:08
So, even throughout this whole weekend, this whole event, everything you're hearing from me or the other speakers ask yourself, how can I apply this to my life?
18:16
How can I incorporate this? How can I do that? How can I be like that? Me, me, me, me, me.
18:22
This is the one circumstance where you can always just say, bring it back to me and actually be selfish.
18:29
The other thing being selfish is being relentless. Keep at it, right?
18:35
So many people give up or start feeling sorry for themselves, this is very classic if you're someone who's in a state of grief or victimhood, right?
18:42
I talk about this in my mentoring program, there's grief, okay? You can say grief, fear and anger.
18:49
Grief is the victim land where it's a very disempowering force, right? You might take some action
18:54
and maybe you get a couple of rejections or you might try recording a video like this and the first few tries don't really work
19:00
and every time it doesn't work, you just feel down and a little bit more down. And there's like, this force pulling you down
19:06
and then you're like, ah, screw it. And you just feel sorry for yourself and you go cry yourself to sleep, that's one.
19:12
Instead, use that as motivational fuel and you can actually shoot up instead of grief
19:18
to a more productive anger where one person that might happen, they're like, oh, it sucks, it's so hard.
19:24
The other person that happens, they're like, again, again. Oh, does it work? Again, and every time they fail, they use that as fuel.
19:33
I've seen it for years, too, when people go out, right? It's like, they go out, hey, nice to meet you and they're like, no, no, no, no, thanks. And they're like, okay, let me go home.
19:38
The other one's like, again, Let's do this, they use it as fuel. The things that will get you ahead are very simple,
19:43
but difficult to execute on, okay? Be selfish, don't go into grief, keep going,
19:51
and then number three, and this is huge, take responsibility meaning it's on you. Never look for someone to do it for you,
19:59
and this here links to of course, victim hood, you hear this, right? If you're a victim, you're giving your power away
20:05
and if your power's in the hands of someone else or some circumstance, there's nothing you can do about it.
20:10
But here's a very subtle approach that people who are still in that state take even in the self-help world.
20:16
They're still victims, right? It's like, oh, I suck, I can't do it on my own. And then what do they do?
20:22
They look for a mentor, they look for a coach, they look for a program to do it for them.
20:29
But that doesn't get to the cause 'cause you're still a victim. What you're simply doing is I don't have any power,
20:36
I'm so helpless and powerless, right? This learned helplessness, it's other people, I would, if that didn't happen or if this person do that,
20:43
I'm so powerless. And then you find out about self-help and you're, coach, do it for me.
20:48
Now, let's just say the coach actually does some stuff for you, nothing truly ever changes 'cause the power is now in the coach, not you.
20:56
So, yes, you got to get mentors and coaches, of course, I mean, you're insane if you don't,
21:02
but never expect them to do it for you. Get the guidance, get the feedback,
21:09
it will obliterate so many my blind spots, but the responsibility is always on you.
21:15
You gotta reclaim that power, okay? And this applies no matter what excuses
21:21
or shortcomings you may have, right? I had so many excuses back then, too. Oh my God, I'm too shy, so on and so forth.
21:26
I'm like, no, no, I can do this, on me. It's very easy to fall into this victim trap
21:32
because you just give your power away and it just lets you off the hook. Instead of being like, oh, I could actually improve,
21:38
it's well, I could, but, and you just hand your excuse off to someone or a situation.
21:43
Reclaim the power. Right now there's nothing stopping you from enhancing whatever aspect of your life it is, nothing.
21:51
And it's full in your control, nothing that happened to you in the past is also hindering that, it only is if you believe it.
21:59
And those were fortunately some stuff that I had. I had that going for me, very, very lucky, I'm like, you know what? I had that persistence, like for me,
22:05
it was so bad before this that I couldn't go back, there was no alternative. And funny enough, I've said this for years,
22:11
there really isn't, right? You know about this now, you've seen behind the curtain. If you don't take action on a lot of this content,
22:17
on a lot of these ideas, now that you see the way you see the path, you're gonna live every single day of your life
22:23
knowing that you could have, you're gonna live in regret and you're gonna try to rationalize your way out of it, right?
22:29
You've seen me on the Curtain, everyone sees the movie, "*Wizard of Oz", right? You've seen behind the curtain, you can't go back
22:34
that I could actually improve my life. If you don't, now you're screwed. You wish you could go back before finding out about all this
22:40
and live in blissful denial but now it's too late. Now that you know there's actually a path, if you don't take it,
22:46
your life will be very, very, very miserable, more than those who don't even know about self-help 'cause you know there is a path that you're not taking.
22:54
I reminded myself that all the time, like, there is no going back, right? Although, yes, it's a fun process,
23:00
so especially when it comes to socializing, it's fun but also very serious. For me it was life or death, I put myself in situations
23:07
that scared me so much in order to grow 'cause even though that might be scary and uncomfortable, it beats the alternative, okay?
23:16
And then I was also very fortunate where I took a lot of action,
23:21
I was able to know in terms of myself, what my strengths and shortcomings were and how to balance that out to still take action
23:28
and I put my ego aside and I would always, always, always look and ask for help
23:35
no matter what. Even if the help or feedback that I got wasn't necessarily what I wanted to hear.
23:42
The more challenging, the better, okay? And this is actually very important,
23:47
I see this sometimes, too, say on the mentoring program where someone will start and then it's like a few weeks in
23:52
and changes start seeping in. And when change seeps in, there's good stuff, of course,
23:57
but there's also some chaos, right? If you right now, step into whatever it is, that ideal version of yourself,
24:04
there's gonna be a lot of benefits but in terms of how your life is right now, there's also gonna be some adversity and some chaos, right?
24:11
It's not all gonna be peachy. And what people do is when they enter that phase and suddenly, ooh, things are kind of changing
24:18
or people are reacting to me or, oh, there's this friend we were really close with, we're a little bit less friends now, is something going bad?
24:24
They go back to that. No, no, no, if you wanna change, if you wanna transform,
24:30
whatever your current life situation is now, your current circumstances are here now, you wanna destroy that, there is gonna be adversity,
24:37
there's gonna be some chaos 'cause you're going against that, if it was all peachy and comfortable, that's you staying in your comfort zone.
24:43
So, you keep going, most people wouldn't, okay? If it does get uncomfortable, good.
24:51
If people around you suddenly start looking at you differently, good. And good and bad, good.
24:57
Don't go back to how things were before, keep on going, okay? So, those were the mindsets that I had starting out
25:03
and I just went really hard, okay? And I went really hard in this competitive state of mind, okay?
25:08
This competitive, you can say frame and you can optimize that and that funny enough is where a lot
25:14
of the self-help industry is at today and the socializing social skills industry
25:20
is here today, okay? And I'll give you some evolutions over the years,
25:25
so if you just take social skills or anything, basically just write this down, okay.
25:32
The truth changes, you could write down or the advice changes as you grow.
25:40
And one thing that will keep people trapped is
25:46
they'll know that it's changing, but their comfort zone will be just hanging on to old advice
25:52
and they just won't seek out the new stuff, okay? So, one thing that I had going for me, that Owen has going
25:57
is we're always seeking the latest technology, the most cutting edge information and we're never just like, okay, this is it,
26:03
we just keep on growing and growing and growing. And if there is a better way, we will immediately implement it
26:08
and there will be no ego attachment to old ways that weren't as efficient. Here's a classic example of that,
26:14
if you take social skills way back in the day, right? This is like 20 years ago, 30 years ago,
26:20
everything was about your lines, right? Hey, learn these lines and you'll be great socially
26:27
and people would memorize lines and try to perfect lines and even go online on different message boards
26:32
and exchange notes over optimizing their lines, they'd even have little stories and sticks and routines that they would perfect,
26:38
and that there was at the time, the best advice when it comes social skills, okay?
26:45
I started working on myself towards the later end of That, but that's how I started out, right?
26:50
when I started, oh my God, I'm so shy, I wanna talk to people, I went online and I started looking up all these little lines
26:56
and I started perfecting them, right? The first time I ever said hi to a stranger, I used this old line,
27:02
it was this old opener called the David Bowie opener. You ever hear of that on, right?
27:07
I thought, by the way, this is the coolest, magical line that's gonna get any stranger to like me and hearing it now, you're just like,
27:14
what were you thinking? This is it, you go up to a stranger and you're like, hey, so do you like David Bowie, right?
27:20
And they're like, I guess so, you're like, well, my sister has a poster of David Bowie
27:25
on her wall and he's kind of old, right? Is it weird that she likes older men?
27:30
That was it, that was it. Now, I'm from Switzerland, so I changed it to Johnny Hallyday, a French guy
27:38
and I did the same thing and I would no joke, I'd be in my room and I'd be writing it out word for word
27:45
including the pauses, everything. and I'd be practicing it out loud on repeat. I probably said it, no joke, 200 times in my room
27:51
before ever even going out and attempting to say it to a stranger. That's the reality I was in, okay?
27:57
So, all about the lines, all about the lines and then you'd look online and no joke, people would post their little story, there'd be tweaks,
28:03
someone would be like, put a pause there instead, and there'd be other cool stories and there was one where it's like, the best friend test, here that?
28:09
like, oh, are you guys best friends 'cause you have the same facial expression. that was one where everyone's like, that's amazing, okay?
28:16
So, practice all that. If you want just a link to my old journey, one side said it 200 times out loud, I finally went out,
28:23
I'm like, this is it, you're finally gonna ask someone if they like David Bowie or Johnny Hallyday
28:28
and I'd walk out in the street and then it was a few weeks of me walking around unable to ask anyone this question, unable, way too scared.
28:35
I'd walk around and this is like during the day, so people are like, no, let me say hi to this person?
28:41
And I'd be too scared, and they pass me and then I tried to like follow them, or like look for a better opportunity to say hi and I was just this creepy person, no joke, walking around,
28:48
trying to ask someone like, do you like David Bowie? And just like way too scared for weeks.
28:55
Then I finally surrounded myself with people who were taking action, right? They gave me the kick in the butt to finally do it
29:00
and I asked the very first person ever if they liked Johnny Hallyday. And it lasted 30 seconds.
29:07
I was like, oh, do you like this? And they were like, I guess so and like, is it weird for my sister to do like, no,
29:12
I guess that's cool, it's music. And then I was very ballsy and I'm like,
29:17
let me follow up with the next one. By the way, are you guys best friends? And they're like, yes, I'm like, oh,
29:23
you make the same facial expressions, ha-ha, have a good one and I left, 30 seconds. That was the first time I ever said hi to a stranger.
29:30
Now, that was the buildup, okay? And at the time, once more is all about the stories and lines.
29:36
One thing I did have going for me then by the way is I celebrated those 30 seconds for I wanna say weeks.
29:43
Most people would be like, oh, it's nothing, it's just 30 seconds for me comparing it to the old me, I'm like this was such a huge achievement,
29:49
I thought I was a God after that. I'm like, I can do anything, like if I asked someone if they like Johnny Hallyday, I can do anything.
29:56
Now, things evolved from there, okay? Everyone's like, well, you know what? I guess when it comes to social skills,
30:01
it's cool if you use some lines and all, but then you're still giving your power away to the lines, it doesn't really change who you are as a person
30:08
in terms of core confidence, right? 'Cause you're still telling yourself I'm not good enough, I can't say hi to strangers unless I have this magical line.
30:15
So, the power is in the line, right? It also comes off very creepy, that that was the frame.
30:20
So then people started shifting to, well, instead of taking these pre-made lines and stories,
30:26
make up your own. And I went through this whole shift as well. I'm like, you know what? You're right, I gotta make it my stories,
30:32
so instead of saying, are you best friends with David Bowie, I started writing stuff down on my own, right? And now what was the new way that I said hi to people?
30:40
Like, excuse me, do you speak French? I'd say this in French, right? Because again, Switzerland, they'd be like, yes, cool, nice to meet you and it shifted to that.
30:47
And then I'd experiment around and have my own stories, but it was still in the lines,
30:52
then it shifted to, hey, it's not about the lines, whether it's yours or someone else's, it's about the principles underlying those lines.
31:01
If you actually work on confidence directly, it doesn't matter what you say. So, notice how there's been a shift now in the advice,
31:08
it's all about the lines, no, no, no, it's about how you say the lineS sub communications, principles, so on and so forth.
31:14
And that there was and still is to a massive extent today,
31:20
where the advice is and that there produces a lot more results, right? You also hear a lot of state management techniques, right?
31:28
Building momentum. There's all these, there was a video we put out like the three Ps, right?
31:35
There's videos like, okay, how to get out of your own head, how to never run out of things to say, right? And so on and so forth and there's all these techniques
31:40
when it comes to state management. Oh, if you feel stifled, oh, if you like that person's outside your league, do this, do this, do this, okay?
31:47
Oh, you go out and you feel in a very competitive state, build momentum, talk to a bunch of people and you'll get into a collaborative state.
31:53
And that's all great, too. However, it then evolved and this is why
32:00
you've been here me talk about for years now, Owen talk about for years now, letting go.
32:06
And it baffles me when I mentioned, for example, oh no, here's a video. When I talk about letting go and say, it's on YouTube
32:12
and there might be a comment like, oh, I wish it was about social skills, I miss the social skills. I'm like, how do you not see
32:17
that letting go is social skills? That's the latest technology.
32:23
But funny enough, and those of you've been around this for again, 10 years or so, you remember this, when it shifted from lines to principles,
32:30
there was so much resistance in the whole socializing self-help community. People just won't accept it,
32:36
people would still say, no, no, it's the lines, no, it's the lines, no it's the lines. There'll be videos about principles or articles
32:42
and all the comments are like, oh, but we want the lines. What's your line? Now it's shifted to that, letting go,
32:48
oh, but what about the principles? Letting go, but what about building momentum? Letting go. And here's we have to realize,
32:54
letting go is the latest technology that will take care of 80% of social skills.
33:00
And you gotta differentiate here to When it comes to social skills, there's 80%, which is around say, state management,
33:07
and then there's 20% a bit more tactical technical stuff. Same with say sales, so on and so forth, right?
33:13
There is some tactical stuff like, okay, what's the situation? Logistics, dah, dah, dah, dah, yeah, you still need that.
33:19
But all the advice, the other 80% around getting yourself into a good mood,
33:24
feeling confidence and not getting stuck in your head, being grounded, not being the most reactive person,
33:29
all of that, letting go. And we have to realize is that the quality of your social skills
33:35
has much more to do with what you remove than when you add on, okay?
33:40
And I'll give a couple of illustrations here. So, here is how one of it, you could say this all evolved.
33:49
A lot of people, this is where they see themselves in terms of their self-worth.
33:54
I'm down here, I'm not good enough, I wanna be up here. If you go out, you wanna say hi to someone,
34:01
they're up here, I'm down here, what do I do? They're out of my league, what do I do? How do we become cooler like them?
34:09
Now, what's the most toxic form, the toxic approach? Oh, let me bring them down to my level,
34:16
let me nag them, let me get them to doubt themselves and their self-esteem so they're now down at my level
34:22
and that is terrible, that is toxic. Thank God that's gone. Next step, okay, let's not bring them down,
34:30
let's bring ourselves up, let's work on our confidence, build momentum, so on and so forth, trying to get there.
34:37
And that's a much better approach. However, what's the problem? You never actually get there
34:44
because if you assume you're not good enough and every action you're taking is to become good enough,
34:49
what do you keep telling yourself? By default, you're not good enough. I'm not confident, let me work on being confident.
34:56
If you are not confident and you're working on being confident, you will forever consider yourself as someone who isn't confident
35:03
for only someone who's not confident works on being confident. This is like the trap, right?
35:09
We think we'll escape it, but it actually chases us. And that's what I noticed, right? Okay, I'm working on all this,
35:15
but deep down inside, do things ever change? No, I just had a lot more material and tactics to cope and to try to boost myself up,
35:22
but at a core, I still didn't feel whole, there wasn't that core confidence. And I'm sure you've heard this word before, too,
35:27
core confidence versus situational confidence, right? Situational confidence is where let's just say,
35:34
at your work, at your job, let's just say you have a better position than someone else. In that instance, you're gonna feel much more confident
35:42
than the employee or the person who's below you, right? Like, the manager versus the employee,
35:47
the manager there is gonna feel very comfortable. If you're out and say, you have certain friends around you, right?
35:53
Really good close friends, like, good vibes. You're gonna feel more confident than if you were there by yourself,
35:58
that's situational confidence. It's a certain situation that gives you that permission to be confident.
36:05
But going even deeper, we always think externally, okay? What about situational confidence externally? What about internally, right?
36:13
Okay, I'm not good enough unless I build momentum, unless I need the line, unless I feel this so on and so,
36:19
we have All of these requirements and it's still situational, it still depends on something. Core confidence can depend on anything
36:28
for if it depends on something, what does it mean by default? You're not confident. Same with this idea of being enough,
36:34
you can't become enough. The only way to be enough is to always have been enough
36:39
for it to be the foundation, same with confidence. What's core confidence? It's confidence that depends on nothing,
36:45
no requirements, just 'cause. That's the type of confidence you want.
36:50
So, understanding this, you realize you can't build up to it, right? This approach forever keeps you trapped.
36:56
And this is where letting go comes into play, if the only way to have core confidence
37:03
is for it to just be there just 'cause, then it has to be the foundation, it has to come first.
37:08
And perhaps I'm not down here. Perhaps there will be things in my life
37:14
that I've experienced, that I started believing that have conditioned me to believe I'm down here.
37:23
And this is where letting go comes into play. Instead of trying to then work on yourself, you start letting go of everything that is convincing you
37:29
that you're down here and you realize you've been here this entire time. You let go of the things that are telling you
37:36
you're not good enough, you're not confident. That's the approach. You remove that and understanding this,
37:45
this leads to the next step where a lot of people, when they have a certain problem, what do they do?
37:51
They ask themselves, what now?
37:56
I'm confident, I'm not confident, what now? I'm anxious, what now? I'm stuck in my head, what now?
38:02
I'm stifled, what now? Makes sense, right? What now? You have a problem, what now?
38:07
How do I fix it? But, you know it's an even better question to ask yourself?
38:12
Can you guess?
38:18
Why? if you just, simple thing like this, by the way, if you just start incorporating it, your life will change
38:25
instead of I'm stifled, what now? Why am I stifled? I'm not confident, what now?
38:30
Wait a minute, why am I assuming I'm not confident? Where did that come?
38:37
I have social anxiety, what now? Wait, why do I have social anxiety? Change the why, change the approach?
38:44
Why do I have this problem to begin with? And that's the shift here?
38:49
I'm down here, what now? Wait, why do I assume I'm down here? And this also applies even on a deeper level
38:56
in terms of who you believe you are here today. And this here, when it comes to the self-help community
39:04
is the foundation and one of the reasons most people just fail completely, because they assume who they are here today
39:10
is them being authentic, right?
39:16
If you're someone who say a little bit more shy, a little bit on the quieter side, you're like, well, that's me, what now?
39:22
Oh, I heard I have to be more outgoing, maybe I should fake it, maybe I should fake it till I make it.
39:27
No, no, no, why are you assuming that that's the authentic you? Were you born that way?
39:34
That's a great question by the way, where are you born always like, oh, just super kind of meek and shy and not putting yourself out there, were you born that way?
39:41
If you're someone who say super negative all the time, were you born that way? Do you come out of your mom's vagina, like, and just immediately complaining like, oh, it's a little too tight squeezing out of this,
39:48
like, no, right? No, so why do you assume
39:55
that that's the authentic you and then now what? And that's what traps us is, you could say you're born free, right?
40:03
And then you're conditioned and things happen that tents you up, you close off
40:08
and you put on this shell, right? You stifle yourself through conditioning and this is now you here today.
40:14
But if you do the now what? This is me, now what, how do I improve,
40:19
it traps you in this forever. Because at a core, you're still assuming this little stifled you is the authentic you.
40:28
Who you are here today isn't the authentic you, what if you're being fake right now?
40:33
What if you've been fake for so lon` you've convinced yourself you're being real?
40:39
That's the shift, well, instead of I'm shy now, what if I've convinced it,
40:44
what if this is me being fake? And then it even changes the meaning when it comes to fake it till you make it,
40:50
it's actually act real until you remember. And again, it's letting go of all this conditioning,
40:58
that's the approach. The same thing, competitive versus the collaborative paradigm.
41:04
You can optimize a certain paradigm or you can drop it, you wanna drop it.
41:10
The more you optimize, the more it entrenches you in that paradigm, okay?
41:15
For example, I'm not good enough, now what, right? Or it's me versus others, you can think of it as like, that's the reality.
41:22
You can work on it, but the more you work on it, as we said, the more he keeps it alive, the more you're trapped there
41:28
and the solution you're after isn't in this paradigm, you have to drop it, okay?
41:36
So that there is the foundation, that's the biggest shift when it comes to these teachings. Now, building on it, when people hear letting go,
41:43
they think it's a very passive approach, right? And when it came to a bit more of that inner work
41:49
or even on the spiritual side back in the day, I thought the same thing, right? If you came up to me back in say 2012, so on and so forth,
41:55
I'll be like, hey, what about this? I'd be like, no, no, no, just action 'cause your ego is just hammer down, like this is the way, must go through,
42:01
must plow through so on and so forth, that's how I viewed it. And in a lot of cases, yeah, the spiritual inner side
42:10
is a lot of just like people being like, oh, I'm just too scared to take action, so that's why I'm gonna focus on this, but true letting go is a very active process.
42:19
It's not just you sitting at home letting go, it's a mixture of the two, okay?
42:24
And this here brings up the next shift, so you remember not what now, why?
42:31
the next one and you can write this down. This is the formula that I teach my clients. - Action, trigger,
42:42
release, repeat.
42:50
Action, trigger release, repeat. Action, trigger, release, repeat. That's the formula when it comes to letting go, okay?
43:00
So, let's break this down. This will go back to it.
43:05
But if you think about conditioning, which I've talked about before, okay? This is how conditioning really happens.
43:11
You're born, you might've heard me talk about this in some other videos, you're born whole, you're born free, right?
43:17
Again, you come out, you're like, yay, what is this? You're this ball of just expansive energy.
43:23
And you come into this thing called the world life, you come into a society and in this society,
43:30
there's certain rules and guidelines. Is this good or bad?
43:35
Good or bad? It's good, what would happen if there were no rules,
43:41
no guidelines, no traditions? It'd be chaos, okay? So, for the most part,
43:48
not all those rules are accurate and good, by the way. But for the most part, the fact that there are rules in this society is necessary,
43:53
we wouldn't function otherwise. So, that's factor number one, you come into a society.
43:59
Number two, you're this again, ball of expansive energy, but can you fend for yourself?
44:05
- [Audience Member] No. - No, so your survival depends on whoever's raising you,
44:11
that's number two. Number three, do you see the world as it is?
44:18
No, right? You have a very limited perception, very limited perspective.
44:24
Even as a kid, right? You don't really see the world as it is. As a baby even by the way, first few months,
44:31
you don't even know what this whole thing is, you can't even form a 3D interpretation of things. Now, because of that, here's what happens.
44:40
You're born whole, you come into this world, whoever's raising you, what's their job? To teach you the rules and guidelines, right?
44:47
So, if someone hears like, let me get naked, your parents be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no. Parents raise you, hey, it's not okay to get naked, right?
44:54
Let me be loud, let me sing right now. No, no, no, no, no, no, it's not appropriate right now, right? You're in a seminar room, don't sing.
45:01
So, you're taught these rules, but here's what happens. Say this is you, again, whole and amazing.
45:09
And say, your parent tells you, hey, don't be so loud right now or don't sing right now.
45:16
Because you have such a limited perspective on things, as a kid, you might interpret that
45:21
as them yelling at you and them not loving you, right?
45:27
As a kid, it's like, when they reward me, they love me, when they punish me and say, no, they don't love me, is that true?
45:34
No, your parents love you either way. I mean, ideally, right? They're just, if someone's like, maybe not.
45:40
for the most part, they're just trying to help you, they're trying to show you the rules, but we don't see it that way as kids.
45:46
Now as a kid, because you depend on your parents, say, they're like, hey, don't be so loud. They don't love me right now, your survival is threatened.
45:53
If they don't love me, what could happen? They could abandoned me. If they abandoned me, I die. So, in order for me to survive,
45:59
I have to please these ultimate beings, I can never have them not love me or I'm screwed.
46:05
That's not true, but that's how you perceive it. So, what do you do? The aspect of me that is loud
46:11
is threatening my survival right now. Every time I'm loud, they tell me no, no, no, don't be so loud.
46:18
So, what happens if I keeping loud? They might just abandon me. So, let me take this part of me and let's get rid of it.
46:24
Anything that threatens your survival, you're gonna get rid of it. Now, because it is you, can you actually get rid of it?
46:31
No, but you can disown it and put it as far out of your awareness as possible.
46:37
And that's what happens, we create this splits within where you could say, here is the acceptable you
46:44
and here is the unacceptable you. This is where being loud goes.
46:49
And this depends on your upbringing on what was acceptable, wasn't, right?
46:54
In one household, for example, maybe they're like, don't be loud. In another one, they might be like, yay, every time you loud, they celebrate.
47:02
In one household, even on a deeper level, right? They might be like, you know what?
47:07
I'm being creative, right? That's being immature, that's not good. You wanna be a very serious person, don't be a little child, what is this creative stuff?
47:15
And you might take the part of you that is on the more creative side, disown it. Vice versa in another household,
47:20
there might be like, be creative. If you go all serious, that's sucking the soul out of your life. So, we all go through this
47:26
and it's very important when it comes to true change to look back on your upbringing, look at your household, look at your community,
47:34
look at where you lived and ask yourself overall, right? Say in that country, what's acceptable, what isn't?
47:39
In my community, what's acceptable, what isn't? In my household, what is acceptable, what isn't?
47:45
And it'll give you a lot of data in terms of what you've disowned. This here is also one of the reasons
47:51
none of us had a core feel like we're good enough. Think about it, you're born and from the moment you're you come out,
47:57
it's like, yay, bad kid, yay, bad kid. So, we think we're only loved
48:03
when we are the acceptable part of ourselves. And by default, from the moment we're born,
48:08
we believe that there's something within us that isn't good, we gotta get rid of, that we're not good enough just to be us.
48:16
Only when there's the acceptable you and this here is the start of that front
48:21
that we tried to perfect and hide behind, every single person here has it, right?
48:28
So, you get a feel for it, you go through these years, all this conditioning, also happens in school, by the way, okay?
48:33
The three, you can say things or people that are really hammer a lot of this in, whoever's raising you, primary caretaker,
48:41
teachers, classmates, whoever has a lot of authority, okay?
48:47
So again, whoever's raising you, that's gonna condition you a lot. Teacher, a lot of authority. Classmates, if they all believe it, also a lot of authority.
48:55
And this is why a lot of people have traumatic experiences in the classroom when they're younger when it comes to say expressing themselves, right?
49:02
They might be loud and people stare or the classmate laughs or the teacher tells you to be quiet. And perhaps showing interest in someone.
49:09
As a kid, everyone teases everyone else, it's like, oh, you like that person? Ha ha ha, they like this person.
49:14
And if they all start laughing because you have very limited perspective, as a kid, you're like, I'm gonna die, the classroom doesn't accept me
49:19
and there's no world outside the classroom, ah. And then you disown that part of you. The part of me that expresses interest in someone,
49:26
let's get rid of that 'cause it's threatening my survival. And this is deeply ingrained in us,
49:32
then you go on to live your life, here You are an adult and you think you're over it and logically you look back, and you're like,
49:37
yeah, that makes no sense, but it's deeply imprinted in you. And this here is what gets activated
49:45
in a certain situation or gets triggered.
49:52
This year, speaking of new technology, this is social anxiety
49:58
or approach anxiety, that's you getting triggered.
50:03
That is something that is poking at that aspect of you that say puts themselves out there or shows interest.
50:10
And it's like, I will die if I embody this, it's not true, you know it, but there's still that same survival instinct that kicks in
50:18
and you can audit your life here and simply look at different situations where say you experience some anxiety or fear
50:24
and ask yourself, is this appropriate to reality? If you go out and you wanna say hi to someone,
50:31
is it appropriate to freak out to be like, okay, let's do this, let's do this, is that normal?
50:36
No, a lot of people also have massive fear when it comes to public speaking, right? If I bring someone up here, a lot of people are like,
50:41
oh, I'm like speak, own it, immediately stifled. That's not real 'cause you know logically
50:50
you're not at risk here, but something inside you gets activated, okay?
50:56
That's you getting triggered. It's when one of those aspects that you disowned
51:01
is coming closer to the surface or you're in a situation that's forcing you to embody it.
51:07
And even though logically, you think it's fine, it's still there pulling your strings, okay?
51:15
Now, this is why this formula is so key. Say you're someone who has approach anxiety,
51:22
you get triggered socially. Step one, you're gonna take action.
51:27
You're gonna say, go out and put yourself out there socially. As you do, you're gonna get triggered.
51:33
The (gasps) response, okay? And this triggered response can be very intense.
51:40
I've seen it over the years, there's a client that comes to mind, this is an Amsterdam, we were out at McDonald's, late at night
51:45
and we were just talking over the night out and we went out and talking to people and again, working on our social skills and it was at the McDonald's,
51:51
I'm like, hey, go say hi to that person over there. And the client, okay, sitting casually talking
51:57
went from, oh yeah, that's cool, it's cool to what? I'm like, go say hi, go say hi.
52:03
Suddenly started tensing up, no joke started turning pale. I'm like, come on, come on and start giving him
52:08
a bit of a shove, like, come on, come on, hanging on to the table for dear life,
52:14
like as if I'm about to push them out of a plane. That was his response.
52:21
That there has nothing to do with the external, that's something inside of him
52:26
that got activated, that got triggered. Now, we think this is bad,
52:32
but getting triggered is actually amazing, why? Because one of those things you've been resisting
52:37
is now coming closer and closer in to your awareness until you're re-owning it, and reembodying that.
52:44
And this here is where letting go or releasing comes into play. Action trigger and then you practice
52:51
letting go of the resistance around being that and embodying that and by doing so,
52:57
you slowly become more and more whole, you divide and dissolve the split, okay?
53:07
Now, what does this also mean? It means going against traditional
53:12
progressive desensitization, okay? Where what people will do is they'll see this, okay,
53:19
action, trigger, release, repeat, and they'll get the action side and they'll even get the triggered side,
53:25
but then they'll go out and say do different challenges or social anxiety challenges,
53:30
but in order to desensitize themselves to getting triggered, but that's actually taking you in the opposite direction,
53:38
this is progressive desensitization, right? Hey, if there's a situation that scares you, that triggers you, just keep putting yourself into it
53:43
until you become numb to it, right? Does this work?
53:48
To a certain extent, yes. Yeah, you will be more numb to it, if that's your intention, that's what you're doing, You'll be more numb to it.
53:55
And I can guarantee you a lot of you are taking this approach, I took that approach for a long time and you know you're taking that approach
54:01
when it feels like this, you go out, say to socialize, you see someone you wanna say hi to, you start feeling the triggeredness, right?
54:08
And then because you've done it so many times, you're just in this habit of like, okay, I'm gonna go to my happy place now and you kind of shift into this alternate kind of state,
54:16
this disconnected desensitized state and then you still take action. You stuffed down the triggerness
54:22
and you kind of barrel through. And that is not good 'cause it's keeping this split alive
54:30
and you'll never get that true confidence you're after because it's relying on doing those challenges.
54:39
And this is where you also have to start thinking longterm, right? Okay, is your solution now to always have to do social anxiety challenges
54:44
till the day you die, right? Same with building momentum, which is absolutely insane that people still try to build momentum.
54:52
That's the dumbest thing ever, like what? Every time now you wanna be social, you're gonna have to build momentum first?
54:57
I know people even, too, it's like they have a date and they're like, before my date, I gotta go say hi to some people to build momentum, what?
55:04
That's insane, that is absolutely insane. It's a good first step,
55:10
but you don't wanna stay there. Having approach anxiety, social anxiety, building momentum, not good, okay?
55:19
And if you had it for a long time, it's 'cause you're still using the old technology and you need to shift to this.
55:25
There is such a thing, people like it's too good to be true. No, no, no, there's such a thing as not having to build momentum.
55:32
There's such a thing as not having that triggered anxiety around putting yourself out there
55:38
if you follow the formula, okay? An exercise I actually give my clients
55:44
where you can also practice this on a more smaller level is with a cold shower, same thing.
55:49
When people, who here does cold showers? raise your hand, cool, right? Tons of benefits to this, but the traditional approach
55:56
that people take with a cold shower is here they are, they turn on the water and it's cold. And what happens?
56:02
It's immediately you versus the cold. And they're like, okay, let's do this, and they try to tense up
56:07
and barrel through in the cold, right? Anyone do that? Tends to be most people, okay?
56:13
That's our default reflex, too, it's something like it's intense sensations, it's like intense cold and our defaults, like, okay,
56:20
go to the happy place, desensitize. It's a very desensitized approach to it.
56:25
What I tell my clients is to start practicing this, do the cold shower, but as you go in,
56:31
see how relaxed you can be. Can you actually be completely relaxed and embrace all those sensations of cold
56:38
and resist that default reflux of tensing up, tensing up, tensing up?
56:44
Can you get triggered by it and just stay with it? That's the same approach that you'll take when you do this,
56:49
you go out, social anxiety. Instead of, okay, barrel it down, let's fight through the cold and anxiety
56:54
and take action and say hi to this person. Can I relax into it and can I let go of this?
57:01
That's the shift, okay? And you can also think of it like this. And if you're someone who's been doing desensitization
57:07
for a long time, you're actually gonna have to backtrack a bit, okay? 'Cause here's what happens.
57:13
Let's just say here's you, super say shy, triggered, scared of putting yourself out there.
57:19
What people do is they then desensitize themselves and like I said, they go into like their happy place,
57:24
again, this is you with like muscles or whatnot and you're like the desensitized, yeah, battle against.
57:29
And they're so used to going into that place, right? That that's now their default, it's like, if you're doing a cold shower
57:35
and you've been doing it for so long, it's like, by default, you resist. Now someone's telling you, hey, can you relax into it?
57:41
You're gonna have a lot of trouble 'cause over so much time, you can condition yourself to always just tense up.
57:46
Same here, when I tell people, okay, now go out and go get triggered, some people have trouble even getting triggered
57:51
because they're so disconnected from what that feels like, 'cause they've desensitized themselves too much. So, what I tell them is, hey,
57:58
if you really wanna get rid of this for good, you're gonna have to reconnect with what it feels like.
58:03
You're gonna have to reconnect with the old you that showed you that's super triggered and then instead of desensitizing,
58:09
it's resensitizing yourself and letting go. Make sense so far, by the way,
58:15
I know we're covering a lot, but, yeah? - [Audience Members] Yeah. - Right, so there's still a ton of action involved, okay?
58:22
Another key quote, it's never the thing, it's the place it's coming from. Letting go in terms of social skills,
58:28
you're still taking massive action, you're still putting yourself out there, you're still getting triggered left and right, so on and so forth, but the approach isn't this, okay,
58:36
move away from optimize, it's I'm doing all this to trigger what is stifling me and blocking me to begin with
58:43
and dissolving that inner split. And by doing so, right?
58:50
So, you dissolve it to here, it's a little bit less, you feel more at home and at ease in your own skin,
58:56
you feel a lot more confidence and it shifts you in that collaborative state, too, because now it's no longer or you trying to hide this
59:04
and trying to optimize the front. Just think about it, right? Say you were to go out and you could just be you,
59:09
there's nothing to hide, you don't have to be cool or it's like, don't see these parts of me, just be you and just relax into it,
59:16
you wouldn't be all stifled, you wouldn't have to build momentum and it would actually be enjoyable.
59:22
This here is achieving core confidence, it's dissolving this, okay?
59:27
And it doesn't mean now that you have to be loud all the time, but your relationship around that part of you,
59:33
it's no longer I'm not good enough 'cause of the loudness, it's just a part of me that I can choose to embody or not,
59:39
but my self-worth isn't attached to it, okay?
59:44
And just think about the traditional approach here, too. People have this split and what they do is they try to go out and they try to amplify the front, right?
59:52
So, they optimize the front, they try to be cool then to optimize it even more, they try to get positive feedback,
1:00:00
approval validation while at the same time, trying to hide this and always experiencing the fear
1:00:07
of someone seeing through. A lot of people, they have something to hide,
1:00:14
they're hiding something, that's why they're so tense, that's why there's so stifled, right? Key question to even reflect on what are you hiding?
1:00:21
So, you go out tonight and say, you see someone you're like, ooh, too scared to say hi to this person, like why, what are you hiding? What are you afraid they'll see?
1:00:28
You can even make the list, there's probably some conscious reasons that come up, right? They're gonna see that maybe I'm a little bit too shy that I'm not used to being around a person like this,
1:00:34
that I'm low value to dah, dah, dah, dah, like, that's the why, why do you have this? What are you hiding?
1:00:41
And then the other one is, why do you assume they're up there? Okay, so this is the foundation when comes to confidence,
1:00:48
same as social skills, approach anxiety, so on and so forth, it's you getting triggered and you got to let go of it not power through, big shift.
1:00:56
- [Audience Member 1] It sounds like when you're anxious in social situation, right? I'm sure you know about evolutionary psychology.
1:01:02
- Yeah. - [Audience Member 1] Like, there are real consequences within those status. And so, it's almost like,
1:01:07
do you feel like you can kind of get to a place where you're trying to avoid what's like a biological drive,
1:01:13
which is like falling low in social hierarchy, right? And so, it's like (indistinct).
1:01:20
- So, there will still be some of that, so I love your question, so notice how I even got it before, so the general question was okay,
1:01:27
but what about things like evolutionary, again, fear, pressure, you raise your status back in the day, right?
1:01:33
You're actually at risk, your life is at risk. So, that there, yeah, it might still be there a bit.
1:01:41
And this is important to understand, actually, love this question. If you think of you getting triggered, think of this as the full extent of the reaction, right?
1:01:48
This is for example, right? Fear when it comes to socializing,
1:01:55
you get this crazy like triggered response. When you let go,
1:02:01
you're gonna let go of all the unrealistic response, so you might let go of all of this,
1:02:08
but there might still be some real emotion there that just stays.
1:02:13
But I can guarantee you, it might just be like a little bit of, oh, this is a little bit uncomfortable, yeah.
1:02:19
But it's not gonna run you to that extent. So, when you let go, you let go of anything unrealistic,
1:02:25
real emotions are there to serve you. But very few of us actually experienced real emotions.
1:02:32
Same with anger, people get super triggered over the top. When you let go, you're letting go of all the triggerness So you're just left with a real emotion,
1:02:38
you can always easily deal with the real emotion. So, yeah, there might be some situations where you're like,
1:02:43
maybe this is a little bit risky and the biological thing kicks in, but it's so small,
1:02:48
it's like zero, 1% that you almost don't even feel it. It's not this crazy response, yes.
1:02:57
Louder. (man speaking indistinctly)
1:03:04
Releasing the tension around it? (man speaking indistinctly)
1:03:11
Yeah, yes yeah.
1:03:18
So, I mean, this is like, if you think of getting triggered, right? Another model, you can say this is your conscious mind,
1:03:25
this is your subconscious and down here is everything you've disowned. When you get triggered, it's one of those things you've disowned
1:03:31
or an aspect or something that's coming up into your awareness and to you embodying it.
1:03:37
And what we do is we try to embody it while it's simultaneously stuffing it down. So, when I say relax into it,
1:03:43
it's when you're actually triggered, it's good, 'cause if there's say layers and layers of resistance to sometimes even becoming aware of this,
1:03:49
it's a lot easier to catch it here. So, relax into it as mean allow yourself to feel it and you're releasing the charge,
1:03:55
stay with that charge and release it versus stuffing it back down, okay? And then in terms of how this even affects you
1:04:03
on a social level, right? You've probably heard me talk about control muscles and release muscles.
1:04:08
Even in terms of self-expression, so much of it is simply getting out of your own way and releasing.
1:04:16
Again, the label we put to it is releasing, just do another, it's like no, releasing is what allows you to be loud like this!
1:04:24
That there, this me, like, even mic off, right? This year is not me controlling,
1:04:32
it's actually me letting go and releasing. I could not be this loud if I was controlling it.
1:04:42
Do I need momentum to tap into this? No, get it?
1:04:49
The difference, though, and this is if you follow, for example, say David Hawkins,
1:04:54
he has a book, "Power Versus Force", it's differences in power and force. Control, what people do is, remember,
1:05:00
who they think they are is fake. So, they're stifled to begin with, they are stifling themselves.
1:05:07
And while stifling themselves, they then try to fight against that and be loud.
1:05:13
They have one foot on the gas, one foot on the brakes. That doesn't work and you'll sense it,
1:05:20
it'll come out a bit more, it's tough to do because this will be the more force, it's like, okay, everyone, welcome,
1:05:26
so we're gonna do that or we're just watching my old videos, that's force. Hey, everyone is just very, ah, at, right?
1:05:33
Hey, you hear me? Am I loud? Versus the other type of loud is not even projecting at you.
1:05:39
Hey, can you hear me? Am I loud? It's actually even just going down, it is drawing you in,
1:05:45
it's not even directed at you. Do you see the subtlety there? That's the difference, people sense this,
1:05:50
these little subtleties, just in the vibe. Hey, what's up? Okay, everyone, so what are we gonna talk about.
1:05:56
Okay, everyone, here's what we're gonna talk about. Release, control.
1:06:03
If you just take the foot off the brake, it'll flow out and you know this just in terms of situations
1:06:10
where it's say you're out socially, you might be very stifled and you're trying to be loud yet in other situations, maybe with close friends,
1:06:16
you're just loud by default, so it just flows out, right? The same as giving you access to certain faculties,
1:06:23
to certain jokes, to certain range of expressiveness. So much of that is just, hey, get out of your own way.
1:06:29
That's our problem, we go out, we stifle ourselves with conditioning and then we fight against it, we self-impose it.
1:06:35
And then we look for techniques which reinforce it and validate that our self imposed stifledness is real
1:06:40
and it stays there. Now, is there then such a thing as you could say,
1:06:48
I mean, here's a whole other one, right? This idea of willpower, same thing. Willpower is something that we do all have
1:06:55
and it is something that is good and that must be used, but you can write down the distinction,
1:07:01
use it for moving forward not backwards. What does that mean?
1:07:06
Right now, am I using willpower? Yes, I am. I'm using willpower to craft out this content,
1:07:14
to link the points, to make the points, to show examples, to answer questions, to make sure it clicks. It's forward focused, it's crafting my words, my delivery.
1:07:23
Yes, I'm using willpower. How do most people use their willpower going backwards?
1:07:29
For example, they stifle themselves and then they use their willpower trying to unstifle themselves. They sell sabotage, they use their willpower to fight it.
1:07:36
They're out of state, they use the willpower to get in state. They're not loud, they use the willpower to get loud.
1:07:42
No, drop all that, so you have your full focus moving forward on this solid foundation of releasing, not controlling.
1:07:52
Otherwise, you're just burning too much in the back, right? You can think of it as there's all the energy
1:07:59
if you're driving, it's like gas, brake, all the energy of like, okay, more gas, more willpower, that's not smart.
1:08:05
If you just release the brake, now you can use all that extra willpower towards actually crushing it, same here,
1:08:10
- [Audience Member 2] Well, I've been releasing for a while, but I still feel that like (indistinct), for whatever reason.
1:08:17
- Yeah. - [Audience Member 2] Do I just keep releasing all the time
1:08:22
so that that eventually becomes my normal or like, how do I get to like, more freedom, I guess?
1:08:29
- If you're not noticing it, you're releasing the wrong way, so that goes into the technicalities around releasing, yeah.
1:08:36
Like, classic example of releasing the wrong way, people try to let go in terms of getting rid of,
1:08:43
oh, there's this thing I'm gonna like, breathe it out, get rid of it. But by doing so you're still labeling it as bad
1:08:48
and resisting it, so it persists. What you're actually letting go of is the resistance around it, right?
1:08:55
A good way just as the cold shower or whenever you're triggered is ask yourself is my intention to move away from this
1:09:00
or to move towards it, right? Moving away, if you're doing the releases like that, it's the same as desensitization.
1:09:07
You're triggered and you're trying to get rid, move away of, like, oh, cold, move away. As opposed to like what I do say with the breaths,
1:09:13
I just breathe in and I literally visualize myself sinking into it and I let it take over. I'm moving towards it not away from it.
1:09:19
It's reowning, reowning, letting go of resistance around it, embodying versus getting rid of, that's one of many,
1:09:24
but that's a big trap people fall into, yeah. (man speaking indistinctly) Yes, yeah, letting go,
1:09:31
you could even argue, letting go is a terrible word, it's technically accepting and embracing. It's letting go of resistance,
1:09:36
AKA embracing and accepting, yes, yeah. - [Audience Member 3] Do you know if you're already scared,
1:09:43
you're releasing and you're becoming (indistinct) or if I'm beginning a new (indistinct) Something different.
1:09:48
- Love this, look for a feeling of relief and at easeness, right?
1:09:55
So, for example, when someone let's go and we'll get to this, at the end of say a release,
1:10:01
they might actually feel perhaps sad or even angry or whatever may come up. But even in that sadness, there's a sense of relief
1:10:08
where they are just being a bit more of who they are. If you think of that split against so much of our energy is trying to disown that unacceptable outside,
1:10:15
when you release it's like, oh, a little bit less, I don't have to hide as much. So, that's what you look for
1:10:21
and then you can also audit it, right? Like, look for relief, look for situations that used to trigger you the no longer trigger you
1:10:28
and overall in terms of how you feel, it's do I feel open and at ease and safe
1:10:35
and people on my side, nothing to hide, all is good? Or is it just very heavy, tense, trying to maintain?
1:10:42
Is there a lot of effort, right? You can write ego equals effort, right? Heaviness, oh, tenseness me versus,
1:10:49
that would be the shift in the vibe. And people sense it also socially, right? It's like, socially, you're like, I need this to work, oh, don't look like I'm laughing,
1:10:55
but don't see this part of me versus all is good. So, that's in terms of the feeling,
1:11:01
you'll sense that shift there. - [Audience Member 4] So it's a bodily sensation instead of it being a mental mind frame.
1:11:08
(indistinct) - Yes, you're letting go of the charge
1:11:13
on a felt sensation level. But by doing so, all of the associated thoughts will start fading away and we'll get to this, too, right?
1:11:21
If you think of that little voice in your head, it has a certain theme, everyone has a different theme, right? It might be a very victim theme,
1:11:27
it might be very scared theme, it might be a very self-attack anger theme. And then people are like, I must quiet the voice,
1:11:33
I must quiet the voice, right? But then by doing so you're not resisting, it's just terrible, the way to quiet that voice,
1:11:40
which ultimately isn't what you really wanna do. What you really wanna do, you wanna change the theme of that voice.
1:11:46
If you had a voice that just kept telling you how awesome you are, you're the I love you, you're awesome.
1:11:52
Would you wanna quiet that voice? Right, so it'll be less intense and more loving
1:11:59
and that's what happens when you start letting go more as well. And all those things like, they're searing, they're judging me, oh, this, gone,
1:12:04
it just doesn't pop up and you don't have to make yourself stuff it down, it just stops popping up. The other thing to really notice, this is another key model
1:12:13
is if you think of this is more on the success level,
1:12:21
there is that split that holds us back, but there are also different core beliefs that hold us back.
1:12:28
And as we discussed that core identity, who you still keep alive here today, who you think you are.
1:12:34
Those are the three things you wanna let go of. So, if you audit your life, here's the model. Here is you, and this is every single person, by the way,
1:12:45
we all have an invisible prison around us.
1:12:51
This invisible force field, everyone has it. And what happens is the goals we're after might be out here.
1:12:58
Well, I wanna accomplish this, I wanna do this, I wanna put myself out there, I want this, this, this. And we go for these attempts to chase our goals.
1:13:08
And things go well as long as you're acting within this invisible prison, this invisible force field.
1:13:13
But as soon as you pierce out, self-sabotage kicks in.
1:13:20
For example, let's just say socializing, you talk to someone you believe is in the same league as you
1:13:26
or you're even outside their league, do you get stifled? No, do you get nervous?
1:13:32
No, right? So, you're talking to somebody like, oh, I'm outside their league, oh, we're in the same league. Hey, you won't feel nervous at all.
1:13:39
Talk to someone who's outside your league, that's where you tense up.
1:13:44
You can actually notice this is called a ceiling of success in terms of socializing around who,
1:13:50
at what point do you start getting stifled, right? Oh, with this person I'm not so stifled,
1:13:56
this person, oh, this person I'm stifled. that's your ceiling. Same with health. There's a certain point where it's like, oh, okay,
1:14:02
I'm being healthy, being healthy and then you start getting maybe a little too healthy and self-sabotage kicks in.
1:14:07
So, if you think of this invisible prison along the border here, this is where you could say
1:14:14
put the guards of self-sabotage, patrolling. And as soon as you try to escape, they get ya.
1:14:20
Now, as soon as you try to escape as well, and you pass this limit, this is where your drive shifts to willpower only.
1:14:29
And this is traditional self-help, this is the hustler trying to hustle out and discipline out
1:14:35
and work ethic and willpower out. And ultimately, what are they trying to do? They're fighting against the guards of self-sabotage.
1:14:43
That's most advice out there, it's not actually success advice, it's anti self-sabotage advice.
1:14:49
And you're gonna have all the tips and tricks to fight against these guards. Oh, I jumped out, I start getting stifled,
1:14:55
what are some techniques? I'll do this to get out of your head, do this to battle the guard of stifledness, right?
1:15:01
Now, here's the thing, though. You can't win and you will never ever win
1:15:06
if you fight them directly, you can delay the inevitable, right? So say you pierce out, you can delay how long it takes
1:15:15
for them to drag you right back in. You can get very good at delaying it. Personally, a lot of my earlier years
1:15:22
in my personal journey, I was a very, like I was a master at delaying it, I was a master at fighting those guards of self-sabotage,
1:15:29
but eventually they'd pull me back, you can't win, okay?
1:15:34
And you can also sense it, too, As soon as you pass this limit, it's like, there's this invisible hand that grabs you and like, nope, not for you.
1:15:42
So, what's the solution? How do you get out of this prison, right? We think we have free will, but in reality,
1:15:48
you only have free will within the prison even if you audit your life, by the way, we're all living in this little invisible circle,
1:15:54
nothing really truly changes. This is why new year's resolutions don't work as well. What's the solution?
1:16:02
Why is there this prison to begin with? Notice the approach, okay,
1:16:08
there's the guards, what now? How do I fight the guards? Wait a minute, why is there a prison? Why are there guards?
1:16:13
Can I perhaps deactivate this force field?
1:16:19
To deactivate it, you gotta ask yourself, what's keeping it alive. Why is it there? And it's three things.
1:16:25
One, past trauma, right? And trauma, again, is simply when there's something
1:16:32
that's just so overwhelming that threatens your wellbeing, that forces you to either suppress or repress, right?
1:16:38
When you take a part of you and disown it, that's you going through something traumatic. And trauma depends on the perspective of the individual.
1:16:46
So, as a kid being yelled at by your parents can be traumatic. As a kid getting lost in the grocery store for 10 seconds
1:16:51
can be traumatic. It's not just crazy situations where I go into war and abuse, yes, that's traumatic.
1:16:57
But, the thing is we fail to address that a kid has a very limited perspective,
1:17:03
so a lot can be traumatic where when we see it now, we're like, it's not traumatic. Trauma, part of the human condition,
1:17:08
every single person has it, or you wouldn't have that split. So, trauma is one,
1:17:13
but then there's core beliefs and your core identity.
1:17:21
These three things, you could say are the batteries that are keeping this generator alive.
1:17:26
And what we do is we just keep living all our lives trying to fight the guards instead of, hey, let's find the switches, turn them off and this fades away.
1:17:37
Okay, so trauma we covered. That's also especially when you get really triggered,
1:17:43
but it's important to also bring your awareness to core beliefs and your core identity, okay? Core beliefs, you can think of it as
1:17:50
there the early beliefs that you form or assumptions that you form coming into this world, right?
1:17:57
So, how do you make sense of all of this? You form an assumption and then you tell yourself, if this is true, then how do I make sense of that?
1:18:03
Okay, well then that's true, And if this is true and that is true, then that is true, so on and so forth. And we have, you could say belief trees,
1:18:12
where, for example, you might be looking at whoever's raising you in terms of their relationship,
1:18:17
maybe your parents, and maybe it's very dramatic, right? Maybe your parents fight a lot, that's just the household you grew up in.
1:18:24
You don't know any better as a kid so you're gonna look at that and be like, huh, that's a relationship.
1:18:29
That's gonna be your model of what a relationship or love is, and you don't know any better,
1:18:34
so you're gonna be like, okay, well, love is a lot of fighting, a lot of drama, right? Check, and then from that, right?
1:18:41
Here's the assumption, love equals fighting, then you're gonna make more beliefs and more beliefs
1:18:46
and if that's true, then this is true and it's all on this foundation of love equals fighting.
1:18:52
Now, these core beliefs more often than not, we're not aware of them, right?
1:18:58
We put them as far out of our awareness as possible, because we don't ever wanna question them. And not only that, but we don't wanna let go of them
1:19:05
because here's the fear. If this is wrong, what happens to the belief tree? It crumbles then all that is wrong.
1:19:12
And we hang on to this map, no matter what. So, a lot of self-sabotage has to do with these core beliefs
1:19:20
that are out of your awareness. If you actually think about self-sabotage, it's really not you screwing yourself over,
1:19:26
it's you giving yourself exactly what you want. However, you're not aware of the part of you that wanted it.
1:19:32
So, here's the example. Say there's, I believe love equals fighting, love equals fighting, love equals fighting.
1:19:38
You get into relationship, say, there's no fighting, you're gonna bounce and you will keep finding toxic relationships
1:19:45
where you keep fighting partners who create a lot of drama to stay congruent to that core belief.
1:19:51
That so much of self-sabotage, it's you trying to say congruent to your map of understanding and your map of the world.
1:19:58
Consciously, I don't want that, but it's much scarier to get that and challenge a core belief
1:20:03
than a self-sabotage and steak and grew into it. So, whenever you self sabotage, and this is a great way to identify core beliefs,
1:20:10
ask yourself, what's the hidden payoff. Why do I secretly want this? Everything in your life right now, you love it.
1:20:19
You might be like, no, if you wanna work on your health and you're like, I don't really like it the way I am physically, BS,
1:20:24
you love it. Oh, I wanna succeed a bit more socially, no, you don't, or you would have.
1:20:30
Everything about your life right now, the whole situation, everything, there is a part of you that loves it,
1:20:35
but you might not be aware of that part. You're getting something out of it. That self sabotage, you're giving yourself what you want,
1:20:42
but you're not consciously aware of it. So, it's key to identify, what's the hidden payoff?
1:20:48
How could I possibly secretly like this payoff, right? It could also be for example, that even around yourself,
1:20:56
maybe there is some guilt over something you did or didn't do in the past. And for some reason, you keep self-sabotaging
1:21:03
and you're like, why? But there might be a part of you that's saying, hey, you're giving yourself the justice you know you deserve.
1:21:09
Or if there's a belief that's formed around success, this is where you really wanna bring your awareness when it comes to core beliefs, okay,
1:21:16
what do I think about success? What's my definition of success? For a lot of people, success is scary,
1:21:22
it's a lot of responsibility, right? And if you think, okay, success is a lot of responsibility,
1:21:28
and then you're like, well, I'm not the most responsible person, you won't allow yourself to succeed
1:21:35
'cause then you can't deal with the responsibility, so core beliefs, key, but then even deeper,
1:21:41
your core identity. Who you believe you are and a great exercise
1:21:49
is to see if you can pick a fictional character, movie character, TV character, book character,
1:21:56
you name it that describes you the most.
1:22:02
You could actually even do it now, right? If you had to pick a movie character and you're like, that is me, that character, maybe not everything that's you,
1:22:08
but describes me the most. Here's some common ones. "Rocky", anyone like the movie "Rocky"?
1:22:16
Right, the underdog, that there describes a lot of people.
1:22:21
Now, if you take this core identity and it's the ones that really speak to you right out of core and you're like, oh yeah.
1:22:27
How might that run your life, right? I have many clients where they're like "Rocky", "Rocky".
1:22:33
The thing with Rocky, if you're the underdog, as an example, that's your identity. You always need a big obstacle to overcome
1:22:41
and people to doubt you and someone to prove wrong. Now, how does that manifest in your life?
1:22:47
Instead of letting success come to you easily, you're always creating this chaos and drama and these obstacles
1:22:52
and putting yourself in these tough situations so I always have to overcome them and prove people wrong.
1:22:57
It runs you, right? Another person might be, well, I'm a goodwill at hunting,
1:23:04
that's a common one or Spider-man's a common one, right? Waiting for that magical moment where the spider bites you
1:23:09
and here you are just waiting for something to magically happen. We all have the same core identity, one that I had for the longest time
1:23:15
was the self-destructive artist where I wouldn't allow myself to fully succeed, I had to destroy.
1:23:21
If I succeeded, I was no longer self-destructive. So, everything out here, right?
1:23:27
If there's patterns, identify the patterns, we'll link to something you disowned, trauma,
1:23:33
or you stay congruent to a core belief or you stay congruent to that core identity.
1:23:40
You don't wanna challenge it, make sense?
1:23:45
Okay, and with that character, you can ask yourself, what are the pros and cons? Sometimes there's pros, sometimes you might be like, why I'm the hero?
1:23:51
And I'm the hero who succeeds massively, but I'm forever alone.
1:23:57
And you might be someone who's actually really successful, but in terms of relationships, friendships, no,
1:24:02
'cause you're saying congruent to kind of this martyr hero who sacrifices the personal life for the glory, right? For the business, for the money, for whatnot.
1:24:09
Someone might also be the victim, someone might be the number two, the sidekick, we're always helping others, but you can never be the main person, right?
1:24:16
We all have this. So, some key audits, what character are you?
1:24:22
And then what's my ceiling of success, key, when it comes to health, wealth, and relationships.
1:24:31
At what point do I start feeling that invisible force that pulls me back, okay?
1:24:38
And if you want another model, it'll also manifest like this, okay? So you see the invisible prison,
1:24:45
but then if you zoom in on say the ceiling of successes,
1:24:50
this is how most people's lives look like. There's the ceiling and the floor and what they do is they oscillate, right?
1:25:01
Everyone had this, say it's health, okay, One day you wake up and you're like, what happened? I got to work on my health, right?
1:25:08
And then you start going hardcore and you start making progress, right? You start cutting out bad food, you're exercising,
1:25:15
you're doing great. Things get better and better and better until you hit the ceiling, start passing the ceiling.
1:25:24
And maybe it challenges like for me, I experience this a long time. It challenges that core identity of being self-destructive.
1:25:30
Hey, I can't be too healthy or I'm no longer Self-destructive. Suddenly, this success is going against
1:25:37
the core identity or your core belief. And this here is when self-sabotage kicks in
1:25:42
and it might be subtle, you might be like, oh, you know what? I can take a day off, right? I've been going pretty hardcore, let's take a day off, let's grab some friends, let's get a nice meal.
1:25:49
Then you have the nice meal, you might overeat. Then you wake up the next day, you're like, oh, I hate too much, you know what? I'll take another day off to recoup.
1:25:56
And the spiral starts and you fall off and fall off until you hit this floor and that's where you wake up,
1:26:02
and you're like, oh my God, what happened? And then it repeats up, down, up, down.
1:26:07
And it gives you the illusion of progress 'cause there are times where you're moving up, but you're not actually moving up,
1:26:12
you're fixing the mess you created, right?
1:26:17
Same with money. Okay, I'm gonna do serious, okay, focus on my finances, work. Oh, I made a good amount of money,
1:26:23
you know what? Let me spend a little bit here, fall off. And we live this yo-yo, right?
1:26:29
Even in the self-help world, people are like, okay, let's start working on myself, and then you slack off and then you come back to the self-help
1:26:35
and then you slack off. So, the key here though, is what's keeping the sealing alive?
1:26:42
identify it, let go of it and keep moving up. - [Audience Member 5] (indistinct) is not necessarily
1:26:52
the fear of rejection but more the fear of those, like, okay, it's not gonna reject you (indistinct).
1:27:04
- Yeah, so there'll be one, finding why and where that came from and ultimately the whole theme
1:27:10
will be detaching yourself worth from approval, right?
1:27:16
So, right now what you're doing is you're taking a part of yourself
1:27:21
and you're placing it on others, and you say, if you approve of me, my self worth moves up. If you disapprove, my self-worth goes down
1:27:28
and now you're there and they're pimping you out, right? I mean, everyone does this.
1:27:37
You wanna hear of one, right? Everyone hears, okay, you sell out when it comes to approval,
1:27:42
when it comes to money so-and-so and people sell out, that's you selling out, right? But here's another one.
1:27:48
Right now, little thought experiment. Let's just say, if say both of your parents
1:27:54
are currently alive, let's just say they died right now and say you're past the grieving phase,
1:28:01
and again, super dark, but imagine a situation where you've actually processed it, you've moved on, they've just peacefully vanished
1:28:07
out of existence. Would the way you live your life change?
1:28:14
And if the answer is, yes, you're like, oh, I would actually do this and take more risks. You're selling out for their approval, too, and you're being pimped out.
1:28:20
Same thing, right? But that's key, right? And this is what people experienced, too, they get approved out, they're like, yay,
1:28:26
this is approved of no, yay, and they're literally there self worth is moving up and down, detach it from that.
1:28:32
Your whole regardless, 'cause what you're literally saying is, and this is also the level of desire, which links to approval is you take,
1:28:40
you might've seen me draw this before. What we do is we take a part of ourselves, right? We take this and we put it here and we put it behind a wall.
1:28:49
I'm not whole, I need this part of me and it lies behind approval.
1:28:55
And then we chase it. As soon as they approve, then I'll be whole. As soon as I get this, then I'll be whole
1:29:00
as opposed to no, no, no, start by being whole. And you can still go after that same goal,
1:29:06
but your whole before and your whole after, right? You can also audit different requirements.
1:29:12
If you sense things like that, the boost, your confidence, or self-worth, write them down, okay,
1:29:17
approvals one, what else? What are all these conditions and requirements I'm posing?
1:29:24
So, that's definitely one to let go of, super common, right? If you see the diagram here, that's the level of desire.
1:29:30
This here, you might've seen me talk about in some videos, this is the next step, so we get the foundation of confidence,
1:29:37
the evolution of social skills and advice, differentiating between real and triggerness this, right?
1:29:44
Then the next step is this map here and the way I personally view this is this is then I sweep that we all do.
1:29:52
So, it's a sweep that you can do, an audit, you can say different things that you might have disowned, right?
1:29:58
If you go through this and actually let go of all the different levels, it'll clear up, you could say a lot of that split,
1:30:04
but it also illustrates the process of transformation. We're at the very bottom, for example, and there's many different maps out there.
1:30:10
There's again, David Hawkins, Frederick Dodson, spiral dynamics, you name it. This is the one that's not overly complicated.
1:30:18
A lot of those maps are just way too complicated, mental masturbation. And the one that I've really seen in terms of my experiences as coach.
1:30:24
At the bottom, apathy, okay? That's the level of just what's the point, right?
1:30:30
What's the point? I can't anyway, screw it, right? Loss of hope.
1:30:36
As you move up, you hit grief, victim hood. And as you move up with each level, by the way,
1:30:42
you get access to more power and more energy.
1:30:47
So, say you tell someone, who's like, oh, what's the point? I'm an apathy, and you're like, hey, hey, hey, it's actually not your fault, you're a victim.
1:30:55
Is that good advice for someone at that level? Yes, oh, it's actually not my fault. You mean I could, but it's because of this.
1:31:03
I thought I couldn't at all, so what's the point, actually I can, but I'm a victim, that's why I'm not? It's actually empowering.
1:31:10
Then there's fear, and as you'll notice with each level, there's different advice, and this is a key thing,
1:31:17
by the way, if you remember this map, any piece of self-help content that you see,
1:31:23
fit it in the appropriate level meaning people mess up because they apply advice
1:31:28
that's for another level, depending on where they're at, right? Like if you're an apathy being a victim is good.
1:31:35
Do you wanna stay there? Of course not. But for someone at that level, it's good. For someone who's then in victim hood, what's great advice?
1:31:42
Take responsibility, step it up. Don't be a little, all right?
1:31:49
That's good advice for someone who is in grief, is it where you wanna stay? No, but you move up, right?
1:31:55
So, take responsibility, you hit fear. You could also start angry and move up instead of, oh, I'm such a victim, it's like enough,
1:32:03
what am I gonna do about it, right? So, at each level, the advice changes and you move up.
1:32:09
The four bottom ones here from apathy, grief, fear, and anger, those are really the competitive states
1:32:14
where it's you versus, now here's the key to catch these themes.
1:32:19
Apathy is me versus others, me versus the world, what's the point and you just kind of withdraw and give up.
1:32:25
Grief is me versus others, me versus the world, and you start feeling sorry for yourself, like, oh, why is it so hard?
1:32:31
Poor me. Fear is you versus others, you versus the world, must protect, right?
1:32:36
They're out to get me, must protect. Anger is you versus others, you versus the world. Let's show them, let's do something about it.
1:32:45
But it's still in the competitive frame, and with each level, too, like I would tell someone in grief, do something about it, shoot up for anger.
1:32:52
However, an anger, that's where it's like, okay, time to forgive, time to let go. But I wouldn't tell someone who's in grief.
1:32:59
Different advice, different levels. Now then there's a shift. From anger, you then shift to courage.
1:33:05
And what I do, this is actually the curriculum I take clients through is the first four levels, there's a lot of action,
1:33:11
you're triggering different things, right? There's different advice and there's different releases for the levels.
1:33:16
And as you start clearing up, a lot of those more competitive states, what happens is you then start shifting into a collaborative state, right?
1:33:24
Anger, by the way, that's a lot of self-help, why?
1:33:30
'Cause most people in society reside in grief, fear and anger.
1:33:36
If you wanna speak to someone who's in fear or someone who's in grief, what's the thing that resonates with the most?
1:33:41
Step it up, hustle, discipline. And that's so much of self-help, right?
1:33:48
The hustler, the discipliner, the no days off. And what do they rely on for motivation?
1:33:53
Self attack. They attack themselves, criticize themselves to take action, that's self-help, right?
1:34:01
Like David Goggins, king of anger and self-attack. Amazing, amazing though, but that's the level.
1:34:08
And it's amazing advice for someone who is in grief or fear, but you don't want to reside there.
1:34:14
So, courage is when you shift to, instead of playing against something and playing not to lose,
1:34:21
what about playing to win? And that's the other big shift. Remember, fighting against self-sabotage,
1:34:27
fighting against being stifled, you're in a competitive state, how do I fight against this? I'm trying to hide this identity, how do I fight against it?
1:34:34
It's all play not to lose, it's all in reaction. What about playing to win?
1:34:40
And this year is when people start asking themselves, okay, what is it that I actually want? What's my win? And very few people can actually answer this.
1:34:47
Everyone knows what they don't want, but very few know what they actually want. And when I asked them, okay, what's your ideal life? They're like, well, there wouldn't be this,
1:34:54
I'm like, what would it look like? What would there be instead? I don't really know, like they have no idea.
1:35:00
So, that's when you venture into, okay, let me start seeing where my real win is. But the level of courage, you tend to play a little small
1:35:07
and there still tends to be some procrastination, some dabbling, then above that, there's desire.
1:35:13
And I put desire here for two reasons. One, you can actually temporarily use desire
1:35:18
to your advantage, to stick to something for a longer period of time. Remember, courage you're kind of dabbling around, right?
1:35:25
You can think of the lower levels as you're avoiding the stick, desires, the caret. Okay, what about the caret? Go a little bit longer,
1:35:31
so you can actually use it to your advantage temporarily. But what also happens, this is the second reason I place it here
1:35:36
is people will tend to get a glimpse of their authentic win and courage and then they sell out for approval, money,
1:35:42
success and desire takes over. So then you wanna let go desire and that's when you really tap into purpose, right?
1:35:50
Dialing in on the wind, being much more detailed and that fuel purpose is the motivational fuel,
1:35:57
including love, it's the one you wanna tap into. So, you can think of it like this, right? At the very bottom, fear is a great motivational fuel.
1:36:07
It'll make you take action, right? Being scared. This is why people have been saying, and I've said it, too. And I think it's great for some of the level,
1:36:13
think of the worst case scenario, no going back. But then as you move up, it's like, what's a better motivational fuel?
1:36:20
Anger, much more powerful, that's the hustler again, but there's an even better one.
1:36:26
So the way you can also think of these motivational fuels is say you're someone who's like super tired, you haven't slept at all, and someone's like, here,
1:36:32
here's a monster red bull drink with extra sugar and chemicals, enjoy.
1:36:38
Will that give you energy? - [Crowd] Yes. - Yes, but happens is people think that's the ultimate solution
1:36:43
and they stay there. What's a better source of energy? Perhaps moving up to coffee, right?
1:36:49
You could say coffee would be anger, great. Is there one above that? Desire could be one, you could say desire is tea.
1:36:58
What about one above that? Someone said, yeah, what about just sleep and just naturally being motivated?
1:37:04
That's purpose and love. So, there's different fuels and it doesn't mean you never then tap into a little pocket of anger,
1:37:10
like, use all of them, but overall you don't want your, you could say human car and engine,
1:37:16
the majority of it to run on those toxic ones. You want the foundation to be purpose and love,
1:37:22
not the others, okay? So, that's purpose, it's like, what's my win, what do I feel inspired to do?
1:37:28
And when you tap into that, right? Including love and even linking it to you, it's like, you are way sharper and way more motivated.
1:37:36
No one can succeed long-term if they rely on anger or desire.
1:37:44
Just like fighting the guards and self sabotage, you can delay it, but eventually you'll give up.
1:37:49
Same with the swings, right? You remember up and down, if you're like, discipline, discipline, discipline, eventually like, oh, you just can't maintain that.
1:37:57
The reason, for example, I'm able to do even a speech like this, right? Just like, I could keep going with work,
1:38:03
so on and so forth is this here feels effortless and it feels fun, it feels amazing
1:38:09
and I'm not fighting against anything. A lot of people can think of, you know, when you say you play a video game, right?
1:38:14
People can't work for more than an hour, they're all tired, but they can play video games, 16 hours, 24 hours straight
1:38:20
'cause their relationship to is very different, there's not the same heaviness. Shift your work to that
1:38:25
and working will be like playing a video game where you can just play and play and play and play and play and play and play, right?
1:38:32
And not only do you succeed a lot more, but you actually enjoy it. And that's the other thing, right? With the other levels,
1:38:37
if you're getting results and again, yourself attacking so much, you can never enjoy it, you're actually scared of enjoying it
1:38:43
'cause you think if you enjoy it, you'll stop taking action 'cause you need the self hate to take action, that's terrible.
1:38:49
And the same with desire more and more, more and more, more, if you're not enjoying the results, those are not results.
1:38:55
Think about it, even though, oh, but externally, it looks really good, yeah. But if you're not enjoying it, you're failing,
1:39:01
that's not good, okay? And even in terms of our win here, what desire will do,
1:39:07
and this is why it's also so hard to really identify what is the want is most people's win
1:39:13
isn't what they actually want, but what would impress others? Most people will go for a goal that others would approve of.
1:39:20
Most people will go for even relationships that others would approve of. Most people go for careers and stuff
1:39:26
that others would approve of, not what they actually want. What is it that you want? It's identifying that and staying true to it,
1:39:32
whatever that is. Even in terms of patterns that run people, a lot of it is childhood and even high school, right?
1:39:39
A lot of people even get into the social skills and that was me where people were weren't that cool in high school
1:39:44
and then you're trying to be the cool person after, you're trying to replay these patterns you missed out on. You're like, I need the girl in high school,
1:39:50
the popular girl, I need to be the popular guy now. And like in your adult life, you're still acting like a little high school kid.
1:39:56
Crazy, okay? But with this here, this is the map that I personally use.
1:40:02
So, what happens is, going deeper on the the force fields, trauma, core beliefs, core identity,
1:40:08
one thing I'm always looking forward is themes. If something doesn't go my way, what's the theme? What's the theme?
1:40:13
What's the level? And everyone here has a default state meaning there's one level here
1:40:19
where you reside most of the time. And you got to identify it, if you don't know your default level,
1:40:25
you are screwed 'cause he won't know what advice to apply to yourself. But we also all have pockets
1:40:32
meaning someone could be, let's just say, when it comes to their job on a level of purpose
1:40:38
and actually love their job, when it comes to work, they're crushing it, yet when it comes to the relationships,
1:40:43
they might be in grief and feel like a victim or in fear, okay? So, whenever something's happening in my life,
1:40:48
I'm like, oh, what happened? Oh what do I feel? it's not going my way? I'm always like, what's the theme, what's the theme, what's the theme?
1:40:53
And then based upon the theme, there's different advice, different tools, right? I think this is my tool belt, like, okay,
1:40:59
let me pull out the tools for that level and there's a release that focuses on that specific level
1:41:04
that I'll listen to. But this here, game changer, life changer, this is the map that I keep coming back to,
1:41:11
this is the inner audits that I do myself and even the meditations I've created for myself and clients
1:41:18
for each level, I listened to those myself, game-changer. And the cool thing, too, is with each of these levels,
1:41:24
and you can also give, there's different advice, but also different missions in action steps
1:41:29
that you can do that will help trigger things to move up. Just as we talked about, action, trigger, release, repeat
1:41:34
linked to each level, all right? Now, the other cool thing,
1:41:41
so this here is also how you're gonna see the evolution of the self-talk change in your mind, right?
1:41:47
That little voice in your head. Another great way to help identify some of the states that run you. Ask yourself, what's the theme, right?
1:41:54
Is that little voice in your mind saying, oh, you're such a victim, it's so hard, maybe you can't do it.
1:41:59
Oh, don't you just wanna go lie down and just eat some ice cream and cry? Grief, right?
1:42:05
Or when things happen, what's your default? Oh, like, you know, some people like if they're like, if they receive something harsh, like, hey,
1:42:11
what are you doing? Step it up. Some would be like, yeah, some other would be like, oh, I just wanna go cry and feel sorry for myself now.
1:42:17
Is it fear, right? What are the threats? What are the threats? What's going on, what are the threats? Is it anger, self attack?
1:42:23
What's the theme of the voice? And as you start letting go, that's how the theme starts changing, and again, ideally moving up to love.
1:42:29
And here's the other key thing, especially socially. Until you hit that state of love,
1:42:38
your social skills will suffer because you will not see the world as it is, huge.
1:42:45
Meaning the state you're in doesn't just hijack that voice and your thoughts,
1:42:50
but it hijacks what you see and what your selected focus, your RAs focus is on and zone's in on.
1:42:58
Meaning just as how we talked about earlier today, say you go to a venue and at first, you're like, oh, so scary.
1:43:04
Oh, threats, threats, threats. And then so take some action and you might get yourself in state and they're like, oh, it's actually chill.
1:43:10
It's the exact same environment, but you're focusing on different things. You can think of it as glasses, right?
1:43:16
You have the fear glasses on and then temporarily you take them off and you put, say, your love glasses on, but you wanna have that as the default.
1:43:24
So, you can look at how you perceive the world, how you perceive situations and the key is to shift the glasses.
1:43:30
And with social skills, here's the thing, if you don't see things as they are, you will not be calibrating to reality,
1:43:38
so if you have fear glasses on, when you see someone you're looking for threats, oh, scary person, threats, how do I calibrate to that?
1:43:45
And by calibrating to that, not only are you off, but you will impose that frame on the person
1:43:53
and more often than not, they will play into it. And this is why even back in the day, you hear things like assume attraction
1:44:01
and people try to force themselves to do it even though they don't feel it. It's very different you feel like, they love me, hey, how's it going?
1:44:06
Versus they don't love me, they're scary, very different. This is how you permanently do it.
1:44:12
And that's the problem, people are calibrating to what they think they see in the other person when that's actually not who that person is, okay?
1:44:20
And again, this year in terms of like, success, advice, you name it, game changer, game changer, game changer.
1:44:28
Now, couple of other things, you want this, you wanna understand this and you want, again, to let go at every single level
1:44:35
while coupling it with accountability and support. I think accountability and support
1:44:41
are necessary training wheels. Not something you want long term,
1:44:46
but necessary training wheels to make sure you don't fall off when things get tough, I would not be here without accountability and support.
1:44:54
I even said, the very first time I said hi, I had to get people around me to finally do it, or I wouldn't be able to.
1:44:59
You need the accountability and support, Anyone is trying to do it alone, insane. And accountability and support can be anything and anyone, right?
1:45:06
You could just ask a friend, told you accountable, but you do need to incorporate it.
1:45:11
If you have the training wheels of accountability and supports combined with this, you will crush it, when it comes to the actual letting go,
1:45:17
there's a few things to keep in mind, okay? For those of you who are in the mentoring, you're gonna get the exact guided releases
1:45:24
that I use myself, but I'll explain it for everyone, but you're gonna get for each of these levels,
1:45:32
a guided meditation that hits on it. And it sounds obnoxious, but this really introduces
1:45:39
the first principle when letting go, so this is done through mindfulness-based meditation, okay?
1:45:44
But when letting go, the last thing you wanna do is engage the mind.
1:45:50
You don't want to engage the mind, it happens on a felt sensation level. So, when I'm personally letting go,
1:45:56
what people try to do is they try to guide themselves or think themselves into it, and that's terrible. I wanna quiet my mind, not even worry about thinking.
1:46:03
So, this is why I do guided meditation, guided releases. And it sounds obnoxious,
1:46:08
but I will listen to these exact same ones myself, no extra ones, literally just what's in the mentoring
1:46:13
and I will listen to my voice guide me through it for that reason, okay?
1:46:19
So, whatever it is you do, like, when you are letting go, disengage the mind completely, okay?
1:46:25
Now, for everyone here, too, if you do want a free meditation that you can start with,
1:46:33
just go to and you can write this down and go to it after on your computer or whatnot, go to transformationmastery.com.
1:46:40
And you'll see a quick redirect and it'll redirect you to a free meditation that you can get, okay? So, after this event, if this resonates with you,
1:46:47
go get that free meditation, it's a very basic one, but just get that one, try it out with what I'm telling you here.
1:46:54
So, when you listen to it, disengage the mind. Next thing, mindfulness versus concentration.
1:47:02
Classic meditation is you wanna concentrate on the now, right, or concentrate on a mantra.
1:47:08
And you want to basically concentrate enough that all your worries or stress or whatnot kind of fades away.
1:47:14
And that's an amazing first step, but the approach here is very different. Remember what we talked about before,
1:47:20
there's the movement towards or the movement away from. What's concentration? Oh, I don't feel too good, let me focus on the now.
1:47:27
And I'm gonna keep focusing until I forget about all this, right? Like, if all of you focus right now, right here,
1:47:34
I'm gonna focus on my finger, if you keep looking long enough, do you see the rest of the room?
1:47:40
No, that's concentration based. And what happens is for most people, they realize this,
1:47:46
it just becomes this temporary escape from their problems. They concentrate for 10 minutes, that's their meditation and then they stop and they're back in, okay?
1:47:55
Better than nothing, but here's what's better. Instead of concentrating on say, the now or a mantra, where a spot on the wall to avoid your problems,
1:48:01
what about focusing on your problems, letting go of them, so there's nothing to focus on to escape?
1:48:09
That's mindfulness. So, instead of now, mantra,
1:48:14
we focus on the stuff we're trying to avoid and it's the same approach with getting triggered,
1:48:19
the stuff we don't experience, that's where you gotta go. The things you're running away from, That's where you gotta go, that's mindfulness, okay?
1:48:28
Now, the way you're gonna do it. And again, transformationmastery.com, get the free meditation is seated position, okay?
1:48:36
I like doing it like this, don't cross your legs, both feet planted, you want to communicate to yourself that you're really grounded
1:48:42
and you can handle whatever you experience, whatever comes up. I also like the palms face down, okay? Just to be grounded, and when I do it, eyes closed, okay?
1:48:50
So, when you do it later, eyes closed, why? Because you don't wanna get sucked into the external, you want all your awareness internally, okay?
1:49:02
As I guide you through it, you're gonna trigger different feelings within.
1:49:10
And your job once more is, let me sink into it, let me experience it and let me breathe my way through it.
1:49:17
When there's charge, when there's stuff that comes up, you gotta notice yourself, am I stuffing it down or clenching or relaxing it, okay?
1:49:27
And then you'll see me guide you through it with the tackle things. But those are some key mindsets so you do it the right way.
1:49:33
Now, one other thing, when you're going through it, it's very common that people are like, oh, you know,
1:49:38
you were talking about this, but my mind drifted off and I'm thinking about this now, that's fine.
1:49:44
Your job is whatever you're thinking about, your mantra is, we're talking about mantras,
1:49:49
remind yourself of this, what are the sensations? If I'm talking about some other topic and you think of this and you're triggered by it, great?
1:49:55
What are the sensations? What are the sensations? And here's another one, sometimes people are like, I don't feel anything, here's the question.
1:50:02
What does that feel like? What does not feeling anything feel like? You can't not feel anything or you'd be dead,
1:50:08
your body would be cold, right? So, oh, what am I feeling? Or if there's frustration, okay,
1:50:13
what does that frustration feel like? Tune into that. And once more, you release the charge,
1:50:18
and the way to think of this, too, is imagine there's all like these strings attached to it, these like chords, they're all pulling your strings,
1:50:25
you're pulled in different directions, what's letting go? Severing that, and this is important.
1:50:33
In life, there is such a thing as a physical connection, but then there's not to get a little too hippy dippy,
1:50:39
an energetic connection. So, here's an example. Say you go through an experience as a kid
1:50:45
where you experienced trauma, right? Maybe in class, like I said, you speak up and the classroom laughs.
1:50:52
Then you live your life and you move on. Physically, that event happened a long time ago,
1:50:58
very distant, but energetically, there's still the link, it's still running you,
1:51:04
that's something you wanna sever. The same are different fears that run people.
1:51:10
A key thing when letting go is sinking into those fears, getting triggered by it and freeing yourself
1:51:15
from that energetic link. So, common one is, people are really afraid of say being alone, right?
1:51:22
There's a few core fears, one is fear of being alone. And I'm curious here,
1:51:27
I'll ask you which one you resonate with the most. Fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough, right?
1:51:33
Not having what it takes, fear of not living up to your potential, fear of being bad and toxic.
1:51:40
Fear of being alone, who resonates more with that one? Raise your hand, the fear of forever being alone?
1:51:46
Cool, surprising, right? Based on people working on their social skills, you'd think a lot more to be afraid of being alone or what are you doing here?
1:51:52
Fear of not being good enough. Something wrong with you, not having what it takes.
1:51:58
Fear of not living up to your potential. Fear of being bad, toxic.
1:52:05
Yup, okay. Now those are just a few, but we all have these, you could say more universal fears
1:52:10
and then there's depending on our conditioning as we discuss more specific ones. Now, here's my advice, right?
1:52:16
What people try to do is they're like, oh, there's these fears, how do I overcome it? What I tell clients, like say someone's like really scared of being alone
1:52:22
and there's the craving of say having a partner, it's like, I can't be alone, I need a partner. I need someone, I need someone.
1:52:27
I would actually have them sink into it, okay, what if you never get a partner? What if that's true? What if you are alone the rest of your life
1:52:34
and just sinking into that, you're gonna start feeling, oh, the triggerness kick in. Whatever it is you feel here, right?
1:52:40
Like, what if you never live up to your potential? What if that's it? What if you see other people go after your dreams, but not you?
1:52:47
What if you don't have what it takes? What if there is actually something wrong with you? You're not strong enough, you're not smart enough,
1:52:53
you don't have it, and you'll just never truly succeed. What if that's true?
1:52:58
Sinking into that, you're gonna feel something perhaps getting poked at, that's one of those energetic links.
1:53:04
And then by triggering it and letting go of it, you free yourself. Now that doesn't mean now that you're gonna go in that direction, that's we think,
1:53:10
if I let go of the fear, won't I go there? No, no, no, your intention is still, for example, to succeed, to meet a partner, whatnot.
1:53:17
But now it's coming from a I'm playing to win, this is what I want versus in reaction to the opposite.
1:53:24
So, it's severing those links. Another key link that runs people
1:53:29
comes down to forgiveness, right? Where this is the classic story
1:53:35
I like sharing to illustrate this. Maybe you've heard this one before, I had a client a few years ago,
1:53:40
he moved from Los Angeles to Ukraine, right? He was doing movies and stuff, he was in his 40s and he was still really triggered
1:53:50
and resentful towards his parents, but more specifically his mom, okay, why?
1:53:55
Because as a kid, he wanted it to musics, be creative, but his parents were very traditional, it's like, look,
1:54:01
you're gonna be a lawyer, you're gonna be a doctor, you gonna be very serious, none of this music stuff, right? And I think he had siblings who they followed that,
1:54:06
they did well, and he's kind of like the odd one out trying to do movies on the more creative side.
1:54:13
And it got so bad that he's like, you know what? I'm moving across the world, moved to Ukraine
1:54:18
and he's doing some movie projects there yet physically, far away.
1:54:23
He still feels the same pressure and self-sabotage, and even feels guilty even though he's far away, why?
1:54:30
'cause although he's physically away, there's still the energetic connection that he has to let go of. Same with the past, different events, people, right?
1:54:38
things that might've happened to you, things people did or didn't do, they did you wrong, so on and so forth.
1:54:43
People tend to like physically distance themselves, but until you let go, that event or that person
1:54:49
will still have that energetic control over you and not just other people, but yourself,
1:54:55
younger versions of you that might have not done better, not the one to take so on and so forth, oh, I'm growing up now, there's still the link.
1:55:02
And for that there, on the more resentful, so on and so forth, it's forgiveness, forgiveness, forgiveness.
1:55:09
So, think about it, that person, say someone really did you wrong, can you forgive them 100%?
1:55:15
Guaranteed, probably a little bit of triggered, and what are those sensations saying? No, that's what you're gonna want to start processing,
1:55:24
until it's a yes, and it's not a you making yourself say yes, it's an authentic yes,
1:55:29
you're being pimped out, there's still the energetic connection. Now, here's the thing, key subtlety with forgiveness,
1:55:36
forgiving someone or something does not mean approving of it,
1:55:41
does not mean say someone did you wrong, there shouldn't be consequences, it doesn't mean now you have to be friends with them, forgiveness is a 100% act for who?
1:55:49
You and only you, it has nothing to do with them. Forgiveness is whatever impact
1:55:55
they still have on you, releasing that. And you will sense key,
1:56:02
you will sense when you've truly severed one of those slinks that or chains even,
1:56:08
energetic chain, you could say, you'll sense you severed it when you look back at that event or that person
1:56:13
or that fear and it's just information, the charge behind it is gone.
1:56:19
And that's another great audit, where in my life is there some charge? And that's what letting go is, is instead of stuffing it down,
1:56:25
it's like, let's be with it and let's start releasing this charge, right? If I ask you, what did you eat for breakfast? Do you get triggered?
1:56:31
No, right? It's like, oh, I just take this, it's information. That's what happens around things that are running, what do you think about that person?
1:56:37
Oh yeah, they did me wrong, that was not cool, but there's not the charge behind it. Oh, what about that fear?
1:56:42
Oh yeah, I don't really wanna be alone, I want to be with someone or so on and so forth. I want to live up to my potential,
1:56:48
but it's no longer the same charge that runs you. Do this, you start being free.
1:56:54
Two other key things, I'm sure you've heard the saying, if you don't have a plan for yourself,
1:57:00
someone else has a plan for you, right. And we always tend to think, oh, it's I guess the government
1:57:06
and people, like, yeah, but you know who really has a plan for you?
1:57:11
All of those things you've suppressed, past trauma, pull in your strings.
1:57:16
You're in that little invisible prison, that has a plan for you until you address it. And then one more key perspective
1:57:22
that really illustrates what letting go is, is remember this.
1:57:28
In life, everyone has goals and I would highly suggest whatever your goal is
1:57:33
as we discussed here before, don't be stubborn, don't be dumb, ask for help, whatever that is, right? I wanna do this thing, I wanna do this thing.
1:57:39
I wanna be art, so like go get an art coach, ask for help no matter what, but you gotta differentiate
1:57:45
between the software and the hardware. If you think of yourself as a computer,
1:57:50
best way to explain letting go. Say you're a computer, right? You're a whatever, iMac or whatnot.
1:57:58
There's the hardware, that's you and now there's all this software that you can install, right? Hey, there's the arts program, there's the cooking software,
1:58:05
there's the business software, there's the social software, there's all this software.
1:58:10
people do is they find out about all this and it's exciting, it's new, it's flashing and they rush in and just install,
1:58:16
install, install, install, install. And then they're surprised when it doesn't really work for them.
1:58:24
Like, well, wait, what's wrong? I installed the software, maybe I need to install more and they doubled down on installing more software
1:58:30
yet what they should have done is run the antivirus.
1:58:35
It doesn't matter how much software you install, if there's a virus on the hardware, you're screwed.
1:58:40
That's what we're talking about here, that's what letting go does. It's running the antivirus so all the software you install finally works
1:58:49
and it works the right way. - Like, this program is such a game changer. The way everything's structured and the material,
1:58:55
it's been already, even for me, it's just been, I'm noticing a crazy change in the way that my whole life's like right now.
1:59:01
- What you put the game is just incredible, there's nothing like that. I've just jumped like a million levels.
1:59:07
It's just been a complete 180 for my experience of existence, that's awesome.
1:59:13
- It's just been so huge in terms of so many of the things I'm finally understanding and realizing
1:59:20
and epiphanies I'm having. - what you do is a huge inspiration to me and I think it's one of the most beautiful things
1:59:28
you can give to another human in this entire world. - You have saved my life and thank you
1:59:40
this is (indistinct). - Sometimes all it takes is just one person
1:59:48
who believes in you, find people who are where you are in life and model them, work with them.
1:59:53
I would not be here if I didn't have people who held me accountable. - Wow (laughs).
2:00:00
- I just felt click and things are changing, this program was just top notch.
2:00:06
- Seriously, like this is master piece. This is perfect. - Everything the way it's set up, the light bulbs,
2:00:13
like, all the support from the coaches is incredible. - It's been nuts. - I just found my tears of joy.
2:00:19
- This was the best decisions I ever made. - Thank you for creating something wonderful like this,
2:00:26
- This program was phenomenal. - This program was amazing. - This program has definitely changed my life.
2:00:31
- I know for a fact I'm in the right place. - This is exactly what I was expecting from the program.
2:00:37
- It's been spectacular. - I've been really lucky to have found you. - Thank you so much, it's worth every dollar.

- Why are you so stifled?
0:01
- (chuckling) What do you mean?
0:04
- (chuckling) What do you mean?
0:07
(Julien groaning)
0:08
Can you do this?
0:11
There you go.
0:13
Imagine I was a photography client, few months ago,
0:17
and say I was someone who was really shy and negative.
0:19
Crack me open.
0:20
What's your name?
0:21
- John.
0:23
- We're meeting, I paid you.
0:24
Here we are for this session, it's just me.
0:26
Are you John?
0:27
- Yes. - Oh, okay.
0:29
Hi. (chuckling)
0:30
I'm here for the pictures.
0:32
- Hi, Julien, it's nice meet you.
0:36
(both chuckling)
0:39
I didn't do, my photography business was not
0:43
with doing portraits, I was doing motor sports photography.
0:48
- So, I brought my motorcycle.
0:50
- Great.
0:51
(audience laughing)
0:51
- Did you not think I rode motorcycles?
0:54
- No. (chuckling)
1:00
No, I'm just kidding.
1:02
- People make fun of me all the time, but thank you.
1:05
- So, who are your sponsors right now?
1:08
- Red bull.
1:09
- Okay, well, I'll put their logo on your print,
1:16
that I'll make for you, and make you look really cool.
1:19
- Let's get to the pictures.
1:20
- All right.
1:22
Usually people want to put on their leathers, and boots,
1:25
and gloves, so go ahead. - Not me.
1:27
- Well, I think you should,
1:29
and it'll make it look a lot better.
1:32
- I was told that you'd make me feel very comfortable
1:34
and confident in this photo shoot.
1:37
- Okay.
1:38
- This is also the law of state transference.
1:39
Whatever you feel I feel, so it has to come from you.
1:42
Guess what?
1:43
Even on an event like this,
1:46
you wanna know who's dictating
1:47
the rhythm of this whole thing?
1:51
- Us. - Me.
1:52
I own you right now, all of you.
1:55
You realize this.
1:56
I walk up, who's dictating from the start?
1:58
Hey, welcome!
2:00
What the, what is this?
2:02
It's me.
2:03
Come on up front, let's go!
2:04
It's me!
2:06
I addict dictate it, I'm not waiting for you to do it.
2:09
And you shouldn't be waiting for anyone
2:11
to do it for you either.
2:13
You wanna have a blast? You do it.
2:14
You wanna be charismatic? You do it.
2:15
You wanna be loud? You do it.
2:17
Of course, there's social calibration,
2:19
but stop waiting for some invisible individual
2:23
to give you permission.
2:25
For real, it's so sad that people do this.
2:27
Even when they're on their own,
2:28
they're like, will something in my environment do it for me?
2:30
Maybe a beer, will you do it for me?
2:33
It's like, you do it!
2:36
And even on a more subtle level, no joke,
2:38
this is something I learned from my mom.
2:39
She, unlike me at a core, is very chatty,
2:44
gets along with everyone.
2:45
Everyone just loves her.
2:46
Strikes up conversations left and right.
2:49
She told me at a very young age,
2:51
it sounds cheesy, but it resonated.
2:53
She said, "I find it so..."
2:55
She wouldn't be as harsh as me, I would say pathetic.
2:57
She said, "I find it so peculiar,
3:01
pathetic, that when I sometimes go out,
3:03
say with some friends for dinner or people I know,
3:06
and we're out, we're eating and stuff.
3:08
And the intention is we're all going out
3:10
to have a good time, right?"
3:11
Like, all of you here, you came to this event
3:14
to ideally have a good time, I hope,
3:16
yet people come to an event
3:18
or they'll go to dinner with friends,
3:20
let's have a good time,
3:21
and then they sit down and they're like, "Do it for me?"
3:26
And they wait for something to happen.
3:28
And they have the luxury of leaving it up to chance.
3:32
And what he said is, "For me, it doesn't matter.
3:34
If I'm going out to have a good time,
3:37
I'm gonna have a good time.
3:40
Nothing's getting in the way of that.
3:42
And I will generate it.
3:43
Hey, if I go out with three friends
3:45
and say, one's a little down,
3:46
of course I'll be empathetic,
3:48
but, overall, if our intention is to have a fun dinner,
3:50
I'm gonna have a fun dinner! Regardless!
3:54
I'm coming here, I'm dedicating X amount of my time
3:56
to be here, I'm gonna have a blast!
3:59
And I can choose the way I will have a blast.
4:02
Whether it's intense, whether it's funny,
4:04
whether it's serious and philosophical,
4:07
whether it's emotional, we're gonna have a blast.
4:10
Take on that mindset.
4:11
Same with you, you're here.
4:13
It's like, say I was that client, like, oh, like that,
4:15
of course you can go back to your script and be like,
4:16
"Well, where's your leather jacket?
4:18
Or you can be like, "You know what?
4:19
Challenge accepted, Julien."
4:21
Let me see if I can generate some really good vibes
4:24
to the point where I can't help,
4:26
but get sucked into his amazing energy.
4:29
To the point where even me,
4:30
if I were to be like, "Oh, but no, I can't."
4:34
It would just look weird, try hard
4:35
and pathetic and comparison to his awesomeness.
4:39
So bring the thunder.
4:43
- Julien, let's go.
4:45
We're gonna do a photo shoot. - Okay.
4:46
- And it's gonna be fucking awesome.
4:48
- Okay.
4:50
- Now, what you have to do is follow my direction.
4:54
Julien, up here.
4:56
Thanks! (chuckling)
4:59
And what I want you to do is stand by your bike,
5:04
and look at me.
5:07
And I want you to look meaner, a lot meaner.
5:10
That's better.
5:11
And I want you to stand up straight.
5:14
Much better, very tall.
5:18
(audience laughing)
5:20
I'm gonna let you go to the bathroom first.
5:23
- Why?
5:27
Why?
5:30
- Julien, help me out, bro.
5:32
- Why?
5:33
- I want you to look as good-
5:35
- Bathroom?
5:36
- No.
5:37
- Oh.
5:38
- I want you to look as good as you can be.
5:41
You can get all the girls, get all the money,
5:42
get all the sponsors.
5:44
Can you picture that in your head?
5:47
- Trying.
5:48
- Close your eyes and picture the sponsor that you want.
5:54
How badly do you wanna be a pro Red Bull rider?
5:57
(Julien groaning)
5:59
Yeah? You want it?
6:01
Okay.
6:02
Now I want you to envision your body.
6:06
- Just a side note.
6:07
This is tensing me up.
6:08
It's not relaxing and adding a smile to my face,
6:11
but constipate me more.
6:14
(audience chuckling)
6:18
- I really don't know how to get you out of this.
6:21
- You do.
6:23
Who do you care about the most in this world?
6:25
- My family.
6:27
- Who, specifically? Pick one.
6:29
- My brother.
6:30
- What's his name? - Dan.
6:31
- Dan.
6:33
Say Dan's on his knees right now.
6:34
There's a gun to his head.
6:37
Loosen this fucker up, or Dan dies.
6:40
No fucking around.
6:42
He dies, you have one shot.
6:44
I don't wanna see Julien being
6:45
all shit up his ass, constipated.
6:49
I wanna see him laughing to the point
6:51
where even if he tries not to laugh, he cannot help,
6:54
but laugh and smile, 'cause you are dictating the rhythm
6:58
and you're bringing the thunder.
7:02
- Julien, wake up.
7:04
Wake up, Julien.
7:05
Guys, help me out, tell him to wake up.
7:07
- Wake up, Julien!
7:09
- I'm awake.
7:10
I'm not sleeping.
7:12
- [Man] Go take a shit, Julien.
7:15
- Julien, do you want this?
7:18
- You don't look like it.
7:19
- I'm serious. - Tell me that you want it.
7:20
(Julien groaning)
7:23
Show me that you really want it.
7:24
(Julien groaning)
7:32
- Remember this is a comedy shoot.
7:34
I'm supposed to be smiling, like, (chuckling)
7:36
as I'm riding it.
7:37
You're directing me in it.
7:41
Crack me open, man.
7:42
Tickle my pickle.
7:49
- Oh, God.
7:52
- Three, two. - There's Dan.
7:55
- No, hold on. - One.
7:58
- Julien. I want you to imagine yourself winning a race.
8:03
Having all the sponsors that you want
8:07
and all the adoration you want.
8:12
Are you picturing this?
8:13
- Yeah.
8:15
- Okay, well, show me with your arms raised above your head
8:20
that you're winning and you have a wreath around your neck.
8:24
- Yeah!
8:25
Suck it!
8:29
- And you're doing a lap around the racetrack
8:32
and you hands are above your head,
8:36
and you're holding a flag in one hand,
8:38
and you're waving it around to all your cheering fans.
8:43
And now you're doing,
8:45
you're gonna come out to the start of the track
8:49
and you're gonna do a burnout.
8:50
- Pause.
8:51
What's the biggest mistake he's making?
8:53
You're trying, which massive respect for,
8:56
'cause most people would literally be like, I don't know.
8:58
Well, family member, I don't know.
9:01
You're trying, you actually care.
9:02
Massive respect, but you're making a crucial mistake
9:05
and you are trying, you're putting in a lot of effort,
9:08
but in the wrong direction.
9:09
What?
9:10
- [Man] The lack of emotion?
9:11
- Nope.
9:12
- Directing behavior, as opposed
9:14
to maybe uplifting the vibe?
9:17
- Yes.
9:18
- [Man] He's telling it, not being it.
9:19
- Yes.
9:20
So there's two ways.
9:21
Remember I talked about state transference,
9:23
whatever you feel someone else will feel.
9:25
Say, you're like, okay, like, make me feel good.
9:28
Option one is what you're doing,
9:29
where you're doing things to me.
9:32
You're like, "Okay, stand this way.
9:33
Say this, do this, feel this."
9:36
You're even trying to put me,
9:37
which is very creative in funny situations.
9:40
And in most cases it'll work,
9:42
but I want you to truly rise up.
9:45
So, option one, this is strategy one, I say to you,
9:48
and what you're hoping is that eventually,
9:50
maybe I'll crack open a little bit and be like,
9:54
and then that'll transfer onto you,
9:55
and then you'll feel better,
9:56
and you'll say something more, and I'll transfer this.
9:58
And you're basically depending on my reactions,
10:01
trying to get me to do it.
10:03
As opposed to summoning it from within,
10:06
as opposed to, instead of whatever you're saying
10:08
is going to me, it's going directly to you,
10:11
which is making your mood, your vibe raise,
10:16
which is then affecting me and sucking me in, right?
10:22
- Yeah. - Do you get this?
10:22
This is a key subtlety.
10:24
You're either saying it or doing it to someone else,
10:27
"Please."
10:27
If it's needy and it does not work,
10:29
or you're doing it to you.
10:31
Now, when you do it to you,
10:32
there are 300 buttons you can push.
10:34
Do you know what they are? - No.
10:36
- Talked about this for many years.
10:38
Fun, carefree, passion.
10:40
Those are the three things
10:42
every single person wants to experience in the vibe.
10:46
In a way, it's your value as a person.
10:51
Everyone wants to experience more fun.
10:53
Anyone here now wanna experience more fun?
10:56
No, it's Seattle.
10:56
I'm curious, I've always wanted to ask here.
10:59
Someone's like, "More Kurt Cobain."
11:01
(audience laughing)
11:04
Two, carefree.
11:07
Anyone here wants to be more serious and care even more?
11:12
He's like, "I do."
11:13
Everyone wants to be more carefree, relaxed,
11:15
and everyone wants to be more passionate,
11:17
excited about something.
11:19
Those three things reel anyone in.
11:23
The key is, and this is what you must ask yourself,
11:25
how can I generate that within me?
11:27
If you view it as three inner buttons that you have,
11:30
how can you press those inner buttons?
11:34
Guess what?
11:35
That Kurt Cobain joke, which I, no joke,
11:38
just came up with it in the moment,
11:40
that was mainly for me.
11:42
In an event like this, when I'm doing a video,
11:44
when I'm doing a coaching just in life in general,
11:47
I have so many inside jokes with myself
11:50
that no one else knows about.
11:53
And it does not matter, because the fact
11:55
that it's an inside joke and I find it fucking funny,
12:00
that rubs off vibe-wise and draws people in.
12:05
Now, this also means, you must understand
12:07
what is your sense of humor.
12:08
How can you, and you can't force it,
12:10
how can you summon genuine laughter on the spot?
12:13
How can you summon genuine carefreeness on the spot?
12:17
What about passion?
12:19
And once you learn how to do that to you,
12:22
on one hand, you're now invincible,
12:24
'cause it doesn't matter what environment you're in,
12:27
you know how to spark that mood, right?
12:31
What do most people do?
12:31
They're depending on the environment.
12:33
Say they go out one night with friends,
12:35
they're like, "I hope tonight's fun."
12:37
Hey, I wanna meet some people tonight,
12:38
I hope it goes well.
12:40
I hope I have a good time.
12:42
That's a terrible victim place to come from.
12:45
It's pathetic.
12:46
When I go out, I'm guaranteed to have a blast,
12:50
no matter what.
12:51
Now, does that mean that everyone's gonna love me
12:53
or so on and so forth? Of course not.
12:55
But regardless of what happens out here,
12:58
I'm gonna have a blast.
13:00
That's the mindset, when you learn how to do this,
13:03
and it comes down to one, introspection
13:05
and learning yourself and two, creativity.
13:07
So one, you become invincible and two, you start being
13:11
this magnet that draws people in.
13:15
Supercharge who you are.
13:17
So, back to you, and I know there's the pressure here
13:19
and it's normal that it's hard.
13:21
But try, think, instead of doing to me,
13:24
how can you make yourself feel so happy genuinely,
13:28
so carefree, so passionate that it draws me in?
13:32
The key would be, even in this moment,
13:35
say hypothetically, you authentically doing this
13:38
was not to transfer onto me.
13:40
And I were to remain like (moaning) the whole time.
13:43
You would all notice that regardless of me opening up
13:46
or not, he would be having a blast.
13:50
- [Man] Right.
13:50
- That's the key.
13:52
I did a speech many years ago in Ukraine.
13:56
I did an event there and I did a seminar,
13:58
and it was a small crowd, it was like 20, 30 people.
14:01
And one or two of them spoke English or understood English,
14:07
quote, unquote, fluently.
14:09
The rest understood a few words here and there.
14:12
So this whole event I had prepped it and I didn't know.
14:15
So I arrived, and I'm like doing this speech
14:17
and I'm making jokes and I'm like, this is so funny.
14:19
None of them understood it.
14:21
It was like I was talking to a wall.
14:23
They were just nodding and happy and being like,
14:25
"Guy from YouTube."
14:27
That's all they cared about.
14:29
So in that moment, if I went into the state here,
14:32
I'd be like, "Well, I'm blanking, people.
14:34
Come on, Ukraine, you speak English?
14:37
What's going on? Why don't you understand the joke?"
14:40
And I'd be all in my head, paranoid, and it'd be terrible.
14:43
Option two is, well, this is hilarious.
14:47
And sure, maybe a part of me is like,
14:49
I wish they understood, but the other one is,
14:51
hey, if I'm here dedicating my time,
14:53
nothing's gonna stop me from having what? Massive fun.
14:56
- [Man] Yeah.
14:57
So same here regardless of, oh, let's see
14:59
if I will crack this Julien guy open or not,
15:03
the other perspective, and this is what people's sense is
15:06
are you having fun doing it?
15:08
But you aren't, you're like, "Is it over?
15:11
Come on, I thought this event would be fun.
15:13
I thought I wouldn't be pushed and stretched.
15:16
Can I just take some notes for some content?
15:19
Can I just pretend this is a real-life YouTube video?"
15:22
No, no, no, you're here in person, we're doing the work.
15:25
And you're just the first.
15:29
So let's give it one more try.
15:32
John Wick in this bitch.
15:35
Here we go, last chance.
15:37
You ready?
15:39
Let's imagine it from the top, crack me open.
15:43
- Julien, are you ready?
15:45
- Hi, yeah.
15:47
- We are gonna have a really good time today.
15:51
And the first thing I want you to do is
15:52
to imagine that you've just won a race
15:57
and you got the perks, so I want you to put
16:01
your hands over your head as if you just won,
16:03
and I want you to imagine yourself winning.
16:06
Can you do that?
16:07
Keep doing it! Higher!
16:09
Put your hands higher, higher!
16:11
- [Man] Say, "Higher" again.
16:14
How do you feel right now, Julien?
16:16
- A little bit better.
16:18
- I'm so happy to hear that, now-
16:21
- Are you?
16:23
Didn't sound authentic.
16:26
(audience laughing)
16:29
- Julien, spread your feet apart
16:31
and spread your arms apart.
16:32
Imagine yourself winning this race,
16:40
(audience laughing)
16:46
- [Man] It's working!
16:53
- Up? Down? What do I do?
16:54
Are we gonna take pictures?
16:57
- Yeah, let's just do that now.
16:58
Now, what I want you to do is stand by your bike,
17:05
and I want you to stand as tall as you can.
17:09
And I want you to imagine yourself winning.
17:11
You don't have to hold the handle bars.
17:12
I want you to hold your trophy.
17:14
It's heavy,
17:18
but you are really, really strong,
17:20
and you can hold it above your head with both hands.
17:25
And I want you to look at me as if you just won.
17:32
(audience laughing)
17:36
Julien, did you win?
17:37
- Yeah.
17:39
- Louder!
17:40
- Yeah.
17:41
- Julien, look at me and say it louder,
17:43
"I won!"
17:44
- One.
17:46
- I won.
17:47
- I won.
17:48
- I won. - Won.
17:50
- I won.
17:51
- I won.
17:52
- Louder!
17:54
- I won!
17:55
- I can't hear you.
17:56
- I feel like you can.
17:57
I won!
17:58
(audience laughing)
17:59
- Julien, louder, I know you can do it.
18:02
- I won.
18:06
But I'm not laughing or smiling or happy.
18:09
I feel bullied into winning.
18:16
- There was some passion there, which is good.
18:17
So you're hitting on some passion,
18:19
but we need some fun and carefree.
18:21
I'm like, "Okay, I'm loud, I'm loud!"
18:23
But you're like, "Louder! Louder!
18:28
Come on, can't hear you, man!"
18:31
It's like, that's one approach.
18:34
The other one is, what about loosening me up, man?
18:36
Add some lube to it.
18:39
- Give me a pointer.
18:41
- Lubricant.
18:42
(audience laughing)
18:46
- Julien, your sponsor is the chain lubricant.
18:51
- Yeah.
18:52
- And so...
18:58
- It's a good effort, keep it going.
18:59
That's really good, keep it going.
19:00
You're trying, that's good, keep it going.
19:02
As long as it makes you laugh, keep it going.
19:11
Most workout I've done.
19:12
Keeping my arms up here after giving you shit for it.
19:15
(audience laughing)
19:19
Holding this heavy ass trophy, man.
19:22
How am I doing?
19:23
- Julien, this lubricant that you love using on your bike,
19:27
it's also good for everything else.
19:30
I think you can use it everywhere.
19:33
- Where should I use it.
19:36
- Anywhere you want.
19:40
- Where specifically?
19:43
- I'm getting there.
19:44
(audience laughing)
19:48
- Give him a hand! Look at that!
19:50
(audience applauding)
19:51
Good!
19:53
Now, notice also how subtle this is.
19:58
What is the one line that got you the most laughter here?
20:02
I'm getting there.
20:05
That got the most laughter out
20:06
of anything you've said today.
20:08
Now I will give you props 'cause you tried.
20:11
Most people, and this is really sad,
20:12
they're just like, "I don't know."
20:14
Or they just keep doubling down on the same thing,
20:16
do this, do this, which you did a bit,
20:18
but then you did get creative.
20:19
I'm like, "Well, come on, man."
20:22
Like I said, "Add some lube."
20:23
And you're like, "Uh, the sponsor."
20:25
So you started connecting the dots.
20:27
A part of you thought the lubricant was funny.
20:29
I thought so too.
20:31
You took it and you started playing around
20:33
with this material to hit that button.
20:36
Then you played along with it, resonated with everyone here.
20:40
And that was amazing, look at that.
20:41
You generated genuine laughter.
20:44
Not for some little line you said,
20:45
but from something you summoned within.
20:47
The challenge you will have now though is
20:49
how are you gonna do this 24/7?
20:51
How are you gonna do this when you leave this room?
20:53
How are you do this with your friends, your family, anyone?
20:56
This is something, by the way, that you don't just turn on.
20:59
It's who you are.
21:01
You should do this with each other.
21:02
I do this with friends, which you're probably thinking like,
21:05
"Oh, thank God I'm not his friend."
21:07
I totally would do this with friends.
21:08
Kidding me?
21:09
I would do this with strangers, I would do it with my kids,
21:12
it's like anyone, it's like, this is now who you are.
21:16
So, what did we cover?
21:17
Recap, give me three takeaways from this.
21:19
- Carefree, passion, fun.
21:22
- That's one, two more.
21:26
- Carefree, passion and fun?
21:30
(audience laughing)
21:31
- [Man] What else did you learn?
21:34
- You're almost there.
21:36
Okay, fun, carefree, passion.
21:39
Number two, so I'll give 'em to you.
21:41
Fun, carefree, passion.
21:42
The law of state transference.
21:44
Don't do it to me, do it to you.
21:46
State transfer over to the people or person in front of you.
21:49
And then three, use your whole instrument.
21:54
- With lube.
21:54
- With lube. (audience laughing)
21:57
- Give him a hand, come on! (audience cheering)
22:00
Bring it in!
22:01
That was amazing, good job, man!
22:02
Thank you.


Search in video

This is Julien and I'm here in Tel Aviv,
0:02
and what I want to talk about in this video here
0:04
is a problem that far too many people
0:06
have when socializing,
0:08
which is running out of things to say.
0:11
Getting caught up in your head,
0:13
analyzing, micromanaging,
0:14
have those awkward little pauses
0:17
where you just fucking freeze,
0:19
and how to break out of that.
0:20
Okay, five tips to never ever run out of things to say,
0:24
five tips to keep a conversation going,
0:27
let's do it.
0:29
(energetic electronic music)
0:56
- So tip number one:
0:57
Don't focus on what you're saying,
0:59
focus on how you're feeling, okay?
1:02
Whenever I'm interacting with someone,
1:04
of course the conversation has to make sense.
1:06
You can't just make random noises
1:09
the entire way through,
1:10
but it's much more important to tune into
1:12
how you're feeling;
1:13
the vibe, if you will,
1:15
the sub-communication because that
1:17
is much more important
1:19
and once you realize this,
1:21
it takes so much pressure off having
1:23
that perfect conversation,
1:24
the perfect words, the perfect verbals,
1:26
and you can just talk and talk,
1:28
flow and flow forever.
1:30
We're all so surface-focused.
1:31
We think that we're going to attract people
1:32
by talking about interesting things.
1:36
What is something that's interesting?
1:37
What's interesting? What defines
1:39
an interesting thing?
1:40
- [Audience Member] Something that you like.
1:42
- Good job (audience laughing)
1:43
in the back. (audience laughing)
1:45
Okay?
1:46
No, it's true.
1:47
It's what you find interesting.
1:49
If you're interested in something,
1:51
it becomes interesting.
1:52
There's no universal rule of what is interesting.
1:57
There isn't.
1:58
It's like, "Oh, I guess the topic of--"
1:59
No, no!
2:01
Every single topic is boring to someone,
2:04
and every single topic is interesting to someone.
2:07
Okay, and it really depends how it makes you feel.
2:12
You could literally be into mathematics,
2:15
and if you go up and talk to someone,
2:16
you're like, "Hey, two plus two, man,
2:18
best fucking equation, four,"
2:21
that'll draw people in because you're so into it.
2:24
It's like if a friend comes up to you
2:25
and they're like, "Whoa, did you see that movie?"
2:26
You're like, "What movie?"
2:28
You don't even know what fucking movie.
2:30
You're like, "Dude, I just bought new bedsheets.
2:32
Check this out, bedsheets!"
2:34
It doesn't matter as long as you're into it.
2:36
So instead of being so concerned
2:37
about the other person, like,
2:38
"Oh, what's an interesting thing to say,"
2:40
what do you find interesting?
2:41
Even deeper, it's what do you find funny, okay?
2:46
You want to press three buttons,
2:47
and I talk about this quite a lot,
2:48
there's three inner buttons,
2:49
three things that we're all craving;
2:53
fun, carefree, passion.
2:56
Whatever you say, try to link it
2:58
to one of those buttons.
3:00
If you find it funny, that's good
3:02
because then you'll start laughing,
3:04
generating some fun,
3:05
and that's what everyone's missing.
3:06
You look outside, everyone's just so sad,
3:09
so fucking sad, so bitter, so down.
3:12
It's rare you walk in the street
3:14
and you see someone like--
3:16
That's, like, strolling down the street.
3:17
Everyone's like--
3:19
No, no, everyone's like this, like--
3:24
It's crazy, that's what you see.
3:26
Walking in the street, except with iPhone 3s.
3:28
Nonstop, okay?
3:31
It's to the point where you even feel
3:33
uncomfortable without your phone.
3:35
If you're standing without a phone,
3:36
people stare at you, it's like,
3:36
"What the fuck, that person doesn't have a phone?"
3:39
You feel very naked.
3:41
So everyone's down.
3:42
If you just generate some fun,
3:43
you'll draw people in because everyone
3:45
wants to have more fun.
3:47
Everyone wants to stop caring so much.
3:50
They want to feel at ease,
3:51
they want to be more carefree.
3:53
Everyone gives way too many fucks.
3:56
Stop giving a fuck, go first,
3:57
and they'll be drawn to you because that
3:59
will transfer onto them
4:01
and every time they're around you,
4:02
they feel a little bit more relaxed,
4:04
a little bit more at ease.
4:05
I'm sure you all have friends who
4:07
give less fucks than you, right?
4:10
Or at least one person in your social circle,
4:12
and when that person is around,
4:14
God damn are things more fun and light, right?
4:17
Like, "Oh, I wish that person's there.
4:18
If that person was here with us,
4:19
oh my God, we'd be way more relaxed."
4:22
Generate that yourself.
4:24
And the third is passion.
4:26
No one is passionate anymore,
4:27
everyone's just, "Meh, whatever."
4:29
Be excited about something,
4:30
what excites you?
4:32
So in terms of what you're saying,
4:34
fuck the words, they don't matter.
4:36
Focus on the vibe, on what it makes you feel.
4:39
If it's something funny, say it, whatever it is.
4:41
It could be the dumbest joke.
4:43
You could even find it funny that
4:44
you're saying something boring.
4:46
You could talk about the most boring thing
4:48
in the fucking world;
4:49
if you find it funny and amusing,
4:52
it'll become interesting.
4:55
Okay, fun, carefree, passion.
4:58
If you're too worried about the words,
5:00
you're screwed, okay?
5:02
And on top of that,
5:03
people are looking at the deeper layer,
5:05
they're not looking at the words you're saying.
5:07
For you to get to know someone,
5:08
of course, say 10%, 20% of your attention
5:11
is on, "What is being communicated here,"
5:14
but the other 90 to 80% is,
5:16
"How do I feel looking at this person?
5:19
What's the vibe?"
5:21
It's similar if you're--
5:22
It's the same as if you're going to hire someone.
5:24
Are you going to hire someone just based on their resume?
5:28
Like say it's a very, very important task,
5:30
you're like, "I need the best of the best for this,
5:34
let's look through some resumes.
5:36
Oh, him, hired, done."
5:37
No, you're going to read through the resumes,
5:39
of course you're going to be aware of it,
5:40
but then you're going to want to meet the person
5:43
to get a feel for the person.
5:45
Is the person grounded?
5:46
Does he look certain?
5:47
Does she look certain?
5:48
What's going on here?
5:50
The same in any interaction.
5:52
10 to 20% is on the words,
5:54
the rest is, "How do I feel?"
5:55
Tip number two:
5:56
Lower the bar for what you have to say.
5:59
You know, we try so hard to just say
6:01
the perfect thing, the really cool thing,
6:03
thinking that will impress people when,
6:05
in reality, even if you actually do manage
6:08
to say that really cool thing,
6:09
the bar's really high and everything you're saying
6:11
is just fucking perfect,
6:12
you won't seem that cool.
6:14
In reality, you will seem very try-hard.
6:16
Okay, it's much better to just lower the bar,
6:18
or even better, destroy the bar.
6:20
Have no bar, have no filters, and just flow.
6:24
If everything you say is fucking gold,
6:26
you just look way too try-hard.
6:29
It's like, "Whoa, this person must really care
6:33
about my opinion, holy shit."
6:36
Okay?
6:37
If you say everything that's perfect,
6:38
it's way too try-hard so lower the bar, okay?
6:41
And that'll help you feel way more at ease.
6:43
If your bar is so fucking high,
6:45
even if you actually manage to say
6:46
everything that's perfect, like,
6:47
"This is good enough, all the rest is not good enough.
6:49
This is good enough, not good enough,"
6:51
even if you say it, it looks way too try-hard.
6:52
Lower the bard or, ideally, get rid of the bar
6:54
and just let it all out.
6:57
Okay, you all have something to say,
6:59
there's that little voice yapping about,
7:00
probably even right now, let it out.
7:03
Even when you run out of things
7:05
to say in a conversation,
7:07
it's not like your mind goes blank
7:09
or like, "I'm present to the moment,
7:12
I am enlightened now," no.
7:14
That voice is still going around and around in circles.
7:18
Unless you come to Transformation Mastery Live,
7:19
in which case it might go blank, okay?
7:23
Verbalize it.
7:26
Okay, lower the fucking bar.
7:28
Tip number three:
7:29
Enjoy running out of things to say.
7:31
Now, this can sound confusing because
7:33
the whole point of this video is to not
7:34
run out of things to say, but guess what,
7:36
when you enjoy running out of things to say,
7:39
there's no longer that worry,
7:40
that resistance, that dread around it,
7:42
and you don't run out of things to say.
7:44
Check it out.
7:45
I personally love, love, love it
7:48
when I run out of things to say.
7:50
You can get better at it, of course,
7:51
by lowering the bar but there's still
7:52
some times where you just kind of blank.
7:55
You can have some go-tos, okay?
7:57
Like you can blurt out random words,
7:59
like whales, "What, whales?"
8:02
Like you can literally say, "Whales."
8:03
(audience laughing)
8:06
Or, and this is my favorite,
8:09
just move your lips and make a sound.
8:11
(audience laughing)
8:13
For real, and words will come out
8:15
and you'll be surprised by what comes out,
8:18
and that's the exciting part of
8:20
an interaction for me.
8:21
It's like when I run out of things to say,
8:22
I'm like, "Oh, fuck, let's make sounds
8:25
and move lips and let's be surprised,"
8:27
and it's literally like I kind of zoom out
8:29
and I'm watching myself, I'm like,
8:30
"What is he going to say next?"
8:32
That's when I surprise myself,
8:34
I'm like, "Holy shit,"
8:35
and you just move your lips.
8:37
Babble-dick, there's a dick.
8:39
Babble-dick, that's me moving my lips
8:41
and making a sound, babble-dick.
8:45
Shimmy-shoo, what the fuck is--
8:46
Babble-dick shimmy-shoo,
8:49
and the other person is like, "What,"
8:50
and now you can laugh and build on that.
8:52
Babble-dick shimmy-shoo.
8:53
You run out of things to say, babble-dick shimmy-shoo.
8:55
You run out of have things to say, whales.
8:56
You run out of things to say, condoms.
8:58
You run out of things to say, sex.
9:00
"What, what did you say?"
9:01
"Sex," and then just keep talking about that.
9:03
Tip number four:
9:04
Focus on a wide range of topics
9:06
as opposed to just one topic and going
9:08
really in-dept on it.
9:10
You know, we try to find that
9:10
perfect topic to just milk and think,
9:12
"Okay, what else can I say about this?
9:14
What else can I say about it?
9:14
Oh my God, there's nothing more to say about it."
9:16
Talk about a lot of things, okay?
9:18
And guess what?
9:19
Even if there is no logical connection
9:21
between those two things, even better, okay?
9:24
It makes it interesting, it's unpredictable,
9:26
it creates an emotional spike that makes it exciting.
9:29
Okay, so focus on a wide range versus one thing
9:32
and just milking it and becoming that one-topic person.
9:36
Talk about a lot of things.
9:38
Go from this topic to that topic
9:39
to that topic to that topic.
9:41
If there's something you really love, then yeah,
9:43
keep talking about it for a little while,
9:44
but don't go one way.
9:46
Don't be that one-topic guy, okay?
9:49
And we think that if we talk about
9:50
a lot of topics,
9:51
there's not much comfort that is built,
9:54
but in reality it's the opposite.
9:55
There is a lot of comfort built
9:56
when you talk about many topics.
9:58
Why?
9:59
Because comfort is not in the words, okay?
10:02
It's in creating a certain vibe of togetherness.
10:07
How do you create comfort?
10:08
By going through different environments together.
10:12
The more environments you go in with someone,
10:14
the more comfortable you're going to feel, the more trust,
10:16
the more of a bond there's going to be.
10:20
You don't even have to talk to that person,
10:21
like if I put, say, you and you,
10:23
like two strangers, and you go do this
10:25
obstacle course mission thing,
10:28
and you're not allowed to talk the entire time
10:30
and the mission is like a week
10:32
and you're helping each other out and shit.
10:34
At the end, although you don't know
10:36
each other's names or anything about each other,
10:39
you're going to have a certain bond.
10:41
There's going to be comfort.
10:43
So the more environments you're in,
10:45
the more emotions you go through,
10:47
the more topics you go through,
10:49
the more comfort, the more togetherness there is.
10:52
So go through a lot,
10:53
and the more abrupt the change in topic,
10:58
the more illogical, the better.
11:00
Meaning we all want to string together this
11:03
perfect interaction where if we talk about this,
11:05
then I'll link it to this because it makes sense.
11:07
If it doesn't make sense, it's actually even better.
11:09
If you ask someone, "So are you from Tel Aviv?
11:12
Oh, cool, what do you eat for breakfast?"
11:14
That there spikes up the interaction emotionally.
11:17
"Are you from Tel Aviv?"
11:18
"What did you eat for breakfast?"
11:21
"Is the sky blue?"
11:22
"What, how does this link to that,"
11:26
an emotional spike.
11:27
So say things out of left field,
11:29
"Oh, yeah, you know, yeah, sports, awesome.
11:31
By the way, are your parents divorced?"
11:32
"What, what?"
11:33
(audience laughing)
11:34
And it doesn't even have to be extreme or polarizing,
11:37
just like, "Oh, that's awesome!
11:38
Do you like the color brown?"
11:40
Shit like that.
11:41
And tip number five:
11:42
Don't take yourself so God damn seriously, okay?"
11:47
It's a conversation.
11:48
It's not a mission where the fate of the world
11:50
depends on you succeeding at this
11:52
and doing everything perfectly.
11:53
It's a fucking conversation.
11:56
Relax, laver yourself, enjoy, it's not so serious.
12:00
It's not a big deal.
12:01
You're not James Bond saving the world
12:03
in a fucking interaction,
12:04
you're just talking to a stranger, okay?
12:07
You think people will remember you forever,
12:09
remember this interaction forever,
12:11
even if you make a fool of yourself
12:13
with someone you don't know who you just met,
12:15
they will forget you very fucking fast, okay?
12:18
Most people you talk to,
12:20
you could do the dumbest shit,
12:21
you could run out of things to say
12:22
and be like, "Uh," and just walk off.
12:25
The weirdest shit, they'll forget you.
12:27
(audience laughing)
12:28
They might remember you for like a minute.
12:30
They might turn to their friends, like,
12:31
"That was weird, anyway--"
12:33
Done, you're out of existence.
12:34
You could come back a week later,
12:35
"Hey, do you remember me?"
12:36
"Nope, who are you?"
12:39
Okay?
12:40
It's very, very difficult
12:43
to make a long, lasting impact on someone.
12:49
Whether it's positive or negative,
12:50
it's very difficult.
12:53
We take ourselves way too seriously,
12:54
we're in the "me" world.
12:55
"Everyone is looking at me, all about me."
12:56
You're sitting here in the crowd,
12:58
"Everyone's looking at me.
12:59
Okay, maybe they're looking at daddy up here,
13:01
but a little bit at me, too."
13:03
No, everyone's like you, in their little world.
13:07
It's hard to pierce through so relax,
13:09
and once more, the more carefree the better.
13:11
And you can just test it,
13:14
there's always some people,
13:15
and it's usually a different phase you go through,
13:17
who take themselves very seriously,
13:19
trying so hard to be cool,
13:21
and you can just sense the stiffness, like,
13:25
"Hey," you know?
13:27
There might be a few of you in this seminar,
13:28
you walk in, you're like, "Okay, let's be cool.
13:35
Hey, what's up?
13:36
Yeah, I'm pretty advanced at this shit, yeah."
13:39
(audience laughing)
13:42
And they're very serious and they're like,
13:43
"Oh, yeah, yeah, that's really good,"
13:45
just way too seriously and it's like,
13:47
Okay, yeah, you seem quite confident on the surface,
13:51
but it's just not a comfortable vibe
13:53
you wanna be around with, okay?
13:54
Confidence is not maintaining this rigid front.
13:58
True core confidence is just relaxing
14:00
and being okay with everything that is you.
14:03
That's true confidence and that's the vibe you want.
14:05
You don't want someone coming up to you
14:06
super fucking serious because then it
14:08
even puts pressure on you, like,
14:09
"Do I have to be serious, too?"
14:11
So I'm gonna just be like, "Hey, all is good,"
14:13
and you're like, "Ah, thank God I can be me."
14:15
That's what people want.
14:17
Go first, give them that, and then laugh at yourself.
14:19
Even awkward interactions make for
14:22
great fucking stories.
14:25
Awkward moments, we hate it,
14:27
those are epic stories.
14:28
Epic stories are either a successful story,
14:31
you're like, "Yeah, and then this happened, fuck yeah,"
14:33
or a really awkward story is just as fun.
14:36
So put these five tips to use right now, okay?
14:39
Implement this immediately,
14:41
and if you wanna go even deeper,
14:43
because a lot of this has to do with our self-esteem,
14:45
our image, the front that we put up,
14:47
and if you want to permanently
14:49
eliminate this front, let go of it,
14:51
I created a program called Transformation Mastery
14:53
that takes you by the hand and teaches you
14:55
how to do exactly that.
14:58
Just click the link here below,
14:59
start your deep transformation,
15:01
get rid of the front, get rid of all the worry,
15:03
"Oh my God, what are people thinking of me,"
15:05
filtering who you are through this fucking front,
15:08
click it and I'll see you on the other side, motherfucker.
15:12
