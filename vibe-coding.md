# Vibe Coding: How to Create Software Without Coding Experience Using AI   
I’ve been exploring more and more AI tools lately, and Vibe Coding has completely transformed how I approach software development. In short, Vibe Coding is simply providing instructions to an AI model and letting it write the code for you. But there’s so much more to it than that. In this comprehensive guide, I’ll walk you through exactly what Vibe Coding is, the best tools available right now, which AI models excel at writing code, and a step-by-step process to get you started creating functional software without any prior coding experience.   
Just a year ago, I had zero coding experience. Now, I’ve created multiple functional applications using Vibe Coding techniques. The barrier to entry for software development has never been lower, and I’m excited to show you how you can bring your ideas to life regardless of your technical background.   
## Key Takeaways   
- Vibe Coding is an AI-powered approach where you describe what you want in natural language, and AI generates functional code without requiring manual coding skills.   
- Tools like VS Code with the Cline extension and Claude 3.7 Sonnet provide the most powerful Vibe Coding experience currently available, with both free and paid options.   
- You can create anything from websites to mobile apps to desktop applications using Vibe Coding, even with zero prior programming experience.   
   
## Requirements   
- A computer capable of running a modern code editor (no specialized hardware needed)   
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Cursor installed on your computer   
- The Cline extension for VS Code (or similar AI coding assistant)   
- An active internet connection to access AI models   
- Basic understanding of how to prompt AI effectively (which I’ll cover in this guide)   
   
## Why Use Vibe Coding?   
Vibe Coding represents a fundamental shift in how software is created. Instead of spending months or years learning programming languages, frameworks, and development environments, you can focus on your ideas and let AI handle the technical implementation.   
The term “*surrendering to the vibes*” perfectly captures the approach – you accept AI-generated code without needing to understand every detail, which enables:   
- **Rapid prototyping** – quickly turn ideas into working prototypes without writing code manually   
- **Democratized development** – non-coders, entrepreneurs, and designers can bring ideas to life without extensive coding knowledge   
- **Quick fixes and debugging** – AI can interpret error messages and implement fixes automatically   
- **Faster feature development** – rapidly add new functionality to existing applications with minimal effort

As someone who started with zero coding experience, I’ve personally used Vibe Coding to create XML files for my [UnattendedWinstall](https://github.com/memstechtips/UnattendedWinstall) GitHub project, PowerShell scripts, [WIMUtil](https://github.com/memstechtips/WIMUtil) (a PowerShell application with a WPF window), and [Winhance](https://github.com/memstechtips/Winhance) (currently a PowerShell WPF application being refactored to C#).   
PS. You can get all of the [Vibe Coding Infographics on GumRoad](https://memstechtips.gumroad.com/l/vibecoding), if you’re interested.   
## What Exactly is Vibe Coding?   
Vibe Coding is an AI-powered programming approach where developers describe problems in natural language prompts to large language models, which then generate functional code without requiring manual coding or detailed understanding of programming languages.   
The key aspects that define Vibe Coding include:   
- Using natural language to describe what you want to build   
- “*Surrendering to the vibes*” by accepting AI-generated code without needing to understand every detail   
- Enabling quick software creation and debugging while ignoring the implementation details   
- Making software development accessible to amateur programmers without extensive training   
   
While you don’t need to understand every line of code, having some basic understanding of how the code works helps you understand how your application functions and allows you to make better prompts to the AI.   
## Key Tools and Technologies for Vibe Coding   
Several powerful tools have emerged to support the Vibe Coding workflow. Here are the most notable ones at the time of writing:   
### Cline Extension for VS Code   
This is my personal favorite and what we’ll be using in this guide. [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) is an extension for Visual Studio Code that allows you to chat with AI models and have them write code for you. It features:   
- Plan mode and Act mode for better project organization   
- Support for multiple AI models through direct APIs or OpenRouter   
- Auto-approve feature for streamlined workflow   
- Ability to execute terminal commands and interact with your codebase   
   
### AI Models for Coding   
Not all AI models are created equal when it comes to coding capabilities. Based on my experience, these are the standouts:   
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet – Currently the best model for coding tasks, though it is a paid service   
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet – Also excellent for coding, slightly less capable than 3.7 but still very powerful   
- Free alternatives through OpenRouter – Services like DeepSeek Chat offer free access, though with less sophisticated results   
   
### Other Notable Tools   
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) – One of the first dedicated Vibe Coding applications with agentic capabilities   
- GitHub Copilot – Integrated into Microsoft products like Visual Studio and VS Code   
- Additional tools: Replit, Windsurf, Claude Code, Aider, Lovable.dev, Bolt, and v0 by Vercel   
   
## Step-by-Step Setup Guide   
Let’s walk through the process of setting up your environment for Vibe Coding using VS Code and the Cline extension:   
### 1. Download and Install Visual Studio Code   
- Visit [code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the version for your operating system   
- Run the installer and follow the standard setup process   
- Check all the recommended checkboxes during installation   
- Complete the installation and launch VS Code   
   
### 2. Install the Cline Extension   
- Click on the Extensions button in the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X)   
- Search for “Cline” in the extensions marketplace   
- Find the official Cline extension (it has nearly a million downloads) and click Install   
- Trust the publisher when prompted   
   
### 3. Configure Cline with an AI Model   
- Click on the Cline icon in the sidebar   
- Choose “Use your own API key” when prompted   
- Select your preferred API provider from the dropdown menu   
   
### 4. Get an API Key (OpenRouter Example)   
- Visit [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) and create an account or sign in   
- Go to your profile icon and select “Keys”   
- Create a new API key (you can use OpenRouter completely for free)   
- Copy your API key (important: save it securely as it won’t be shown again)   
- Paste the API key into Cline and click “Let’s Go”   
   
### 5. Select Your AI Model   
- Choose a model from the available options (Claude 3.7 Sonnet is recommended for best results, but has a cost)   
- For free options, type “free” in the search to see available free models   
- Free models like DeepSeek Chat or Google’s models work but with less sophisticated results   
   
### 6. Configure Custom Instructions   
- Add custom instructions to guide the AI’s behavior (these are added to every system prompt)   
- Keep instructions concise to avoid using too much of the context window   
   
Example instructions:
`Always test the project at the end to ensure it doesn't contain errors. Don't create placeholder code unless planning to expand on it later. Code from A to Z rather than just small parts that don't fulfill the user's needs. Keep project files between 300-500 lines where possible. Don't duplicate code; build upon existing implementations.`   
### 7. Configure Auto-Approve Settings   
- Click on the auto-approve button in the Cline interface   
- Select which permissions you want to grant (reading files, editing files, executing commands, etc.)   
- These settings allow Cline to work more efficiently without requiring approval for every action   
   
### 8. Create a Project Folder   
- Go to File > Open Folder to create a workspace for your project   
- Create a new folder for your project and select it   
- This folder will serve as your workspace for the project   
   
## Creating Your First Application with Vibe Coding   
Now that your environment is set up, let’s create a simple application to demonstrate the power of Vibe Coding:   
### 1. Plan Your Project   
- Decide what you want to build before engaging with the AI   
- Consider the features, UI design, and functionality you want   
- This planning phase is crucial for getting good results from the AI   
   
### 2. Craft Your Prompt   
The quality of your prompt significantly impacts the quality of the code the AI generates. Here’s an example of a well-structured prompt:   
> Create a C# WPF application that gives users the ability to toggle the start menu on the taskbar in Windows 11 between centered and left aligned. Use a registry entry to accomplish this. Give the user either a button or slider that helps them toggle between these two alignments. The window can be simple, but modern.   

Notice how this prompt:   
- Specifies the technology (C# WPF)   
- Clearly describes the functionality (toggling taskbar alignment)   
- Mentions implementation details (using registry entries)   
- Provides UI guidance (button or slider, simple but modern)   
   
### 3. Use Plan Mode First   
- Start in Plan mode to let the AI architect a solution before implementation   
- Review the AI’s proposed approach and make adjustments if needed   
- Once satisfied with the plan, switch to Act mode for implementation   
   
### 4. Let the AI Generate the Code   
- In Act mode, the AI will start creating the necessary files for your application   
- It will handle creating the project structure, UI elements, and functionality   
- The AI may need to install dependencies or SDKs, which it will request permission for   
   
### 5. Handle Any Errors   
- If the application fails to build or run, copy the error messages and paste them back to Cline   
- The AI will analyze the errors and make the necessary corrections   
- This debugging process helps you learn more about how the code works   
   
### 6. Test the Application   
- Once the application builds successfully, run it to test the functionality   
- Verify that it works as expected (in our example, toggling the taskbar alignment)   
- Make note of any improvements or changes you’d like to make   
   
### 7. Request Improvements   
- If you want to enhance the application, simply describe the changes you want   
- For example: “Can you make the UI more modern with rounded corners and a dark theme option?”   
- The AI will update the code to implement your requested changes   
   
## Comparing AI Models for Vibe Coding   
Different AI models produce significantly different results, even with identical prompts. Here’s a comparison based on a simple website creation task:   
### Free Models (e.g., DeepSeek Chat)   
- Produce functional but basic implementations   
- May lack sophisticated features or polished UI   
- Good for simple projects or learning the basics   
   
### Premium Models (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet)   
- Create more sophisticated, feature-rich implementations   
- Include additional features without being explicitly asked   
- Generate cleaner, more maintainable code   
- Better at understanding and implementing visual feedback from screenshots   
   
### Cost Considerations   
While premium models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet produce better results, they come with a cost. For example, creating a complete website with Claude 3.7 might cost around $0.50-$1.00 in API usage. For many projects, this cost is negligible compared to the time saved and quality of results.   
## Common Pitfalls to Avoid   
As you get started with Vibe Coding, be aware of these common mistakes:   
> Note: Even experienced developers can fall into these traps when first using AI coding tools. Don’t worry if you make these mistakes – they’re part of the learning process.   

- Trusting the AI too much, especially with large codebases where hallucination problems can occur   
- Allowing AI to dictate project direction rather than maintaining clear creative control   
- Not documenting guidelines for the AI to follow   
- Skipping the planning phase and diving straight into coding   
   
> Important: As a beginner, you will naturally trust the AI more since you don’t have experience to guide you. This is okay! The process of troubleshooting AI mistakes actually accelerates your learning about how code works.   

## Vibe Coding Workflow   
For the most efficient Vibe Coding experience, follow this workflow:   
1. **Plan your project** – Decide on your idea, UI design, and feature set before engaging with AI   
2. **Document guidelines** – Create clear instructions for the AI to follow   
3. **Provide clear, specific prompts** – Be detailed about what you want to build   
4. **Review the output** – Check the generated code for any errors or issues   
5. **Iterate and improve** – Use feedback from testing to refine your application   
   
## Conclusion   
Vibe Coding represents a fundamental shift in how software is created. By leveraging AI models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet through tools like the Cline extension for VS Code, anyone with an idea can bring it to life without extensive coding knowledge.   
I started with zero coding experience just a year ago, and through Vibe Coding, I’ve created multiple functional applications including UnattendedWinstall, WIMUtil, and Winhance. The barrier to entry for software development has never been lower.   
Whether you’re looking to create a simple website, a mobile app, or a desktop application, Vibe Coding provides a pathway to turn your ideas into reality. The technology is evolving rapidly, with new and improved models being released regularly.   
Remember that while you don’t need to understand every line of code, the process of working with AI and troubleshooting issues will naturally increase your understanding of how software works. This knowledge will make you more effective at prompting the AI and creating more sophisticated applications over time.   
Start with small projects, learn from the process, and gradually tackle more complex ideas. The future of software development is here, and it’s accessible to everyone.
