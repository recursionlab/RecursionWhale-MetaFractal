
- This is Julian, and I'm here with best selling author Robert Greene who just released his new book, The Laws of Human Nature.
0:07
I put a link to it here below, as it is a must-read, and what I thought we could do here is just jump right in
0:14
on the importance of learning about human nature. Why someone should learn this,
0:20
and I wouldn't even say importance, I would say necessity. Why someone is really screwed without learning about what you talk about in this book.
The source of pain in your life
0:27
- The point of my book, is that the major source of pain in your life is people, the people around you.
0:37
You're not maybe thinking in these terms, but I'll explain what I mean in the following way.
0:42
So, we wanna be able to feel, like in life, with our friends, our colleagues,
0:48
our loved ones, that we can influence them. That we can move them in our direction,
0:53
that we have the ability to persuade them to do something that's in our interest. And the feeling that we can't do that is deeply painful.
1:02
It causes lots of amounts of frustration and resentment that can sit inside of us, and linger,
1:09
and kind of ruin our attitude towards life.
1:15
Sometimes there are toxic people in this world, and they enter our lives and we didn't foresee them.
1:24
Someone who's a raging narcissist or whatever, and we get dragged into a relationship with them,
1:29
or we hire them as a business partner or an employee, and they ruin our lives, and they cause all kinds
1:36
of emotional damage that can take years to get over. And then another level is, we have friends,
1:46
and partners and spouses, and sometimes the connections
1:53
between us are very fragile and thin. Our friendships are continually breaking up,
1:59
our friends do something that surprises us and upsets us. And so we often find that our relationships with people,
2:07
we're not connecting to them on a deep level. So you add all this up, sort of frustration and resentment
Loneliness and alienation
2:15
that we have no influence over people. Bad types that enter our lives
2:21
and cause us residual pain, and then relationships that aren't really strong and aren't connecting.
2:28
You add all that up and you can have, as a social animal that can equal a great deal of pain.
2:37
We don't associate it this way, but a lot of illnesses and heart disease
2:44
are associated with loneliness, and I think a lot of people feel especially
2:49
in this world today, a bit of alienation and disconnect from other people. And so this is a book that I think can reverse that process.
2:59
I believe that in the world that we're living in today with social media and technology,
3:04
that most of us find ourselves withdrawing. We're immersed in our smartphones, et cetera.
3:11
We're not connecting in any deeper ways so these tendencies and this pain that I'm talking about is actually getting worse.
3:19
And so this a book about how to reverse that, how to recognize those toxic people well in advance,
3:28
before you get entangled in their mess, before you become enmeshed in their dramas.
3:35
Learn the real way towards influencing people, towards working with their will-power
3:41
to get them to do what you want, so you don't feel this constant frustration.
3:47
And then, how to connect to people on a much deeper level as a human being. I talk a lot in this book about empathy,
3:54
and as a social animal that we are, we have this ability to understand people
4:03
in a way that's non-verbal, we can connect to them in a visceral way through our empathy.
4:09
I can begin to understand what it's like to be Julian. I'm not you, I can't be inside your head,
4:15
I can't know you from the inside out, but I can get closer to that. We have an almost telepathic power if we tap into it,
4:23
but we don't tap into it because we're so immersed in ourselves, we're so self-absorbed. - Yeah, there's a quote that I love,
Virtual world
4:29
it says that today we're more connected than ever with social media, Facebook, Instagram, our phones,
4:36
but we're also more alone than ever. We do live in that virtual world.
4:42
Right now, the example I always use is, you don't even have to, if you think of say pursuing
4:48
a purpose or pursuing something that you love, you don't have to go out of the house to do that. Someone could get lost in a video game.
4:54
Back in the day it was World of Warcraft, and in that game you could just stay at home, and it virtually fulfills all of your needs to some extent
5:03
where you can create tribes, you can socialize in there, you can level up so you have that sense of accomplishment,
5:09
there's different quests, and you never leave the house. Because of that you lose touch with what you said,
5:17
that empathy, the dynamics of understanding a person, 'cause you're just in this 2D virtual realm.
Empathy
5:24
- I think we've all had this experience. If you've ever been, for whatever reason, alone a lot,
5:31
let's say you had an illness or let's say you're depressed, or let's say you're in a foreign country,
5:36
you'll notice that when you're suddenly thrust among people you feel a little bit awkward.
5:42
It takes a little while to adjust. But in the opposite, if you're very social, if you're always around people,
5:48
you're going to events, and you're meeting a lot of them, something kicks in and it's easy to be around them,
5:54
and you're more attuned to people. Well we're not around people enough.
6:00
We're not interacting with them, we're interacting with them virtually, or we're immersed in our technology.
6:07
And so just by the fact that you're out there socializing with people, one-on-one communication,
6:14
you're gonna develop this skill. We're animals, we're living, breathing animals. We have blood, and heart,
6:22
and we connect to people viscerally, physically. I see your eye contact, I'm able to connect with you
6:30
on that level, I'm able to hear the tone of your voice, I'm able to read your body language.
6:35
We read people in a way that we're not even conscious of. We pick up signals that people are giving off
6:42
through their non-verbal communication. When you're not paying attention, I notice in restaurants
6:49
there'll be couples, and neither of them are looking at each other, they're both like this-- - Buried on their phone, yeah.
6:55
- So, you're missing all of this information that people are giving out about themselves,
7:00
about their likes, about what excites them, about what makes them an individual.
7:05
You're missing all of that, because you're not paying attention-- - I would see it for years, 'cause I've taught it for years
7:11
when it comes to just interacting with other people. Learn about the different dynamics, learn about the context.
7:17
Who's this person, what are they feeling right now, what is appropriate to the situation, while still remaining authentic.
7:24
And I would see less and less of this skill, 'cause it is a skill, it's something you develop.
7:29
And it would shock me, I'm like how do people not know this? To the point where it was even during say a seminar room context, that's the context,
7:37
because people are so used to taking in information online like watching this video here,
7:43
there's the comment box below. Or if you're watching a webinar there's the chat box where you can just leave your comments, ask your questions,
7:51
and I would see it where in seminar rooms, I would be, quite a few times, randomly interrupted.
7:57
Someone just raisin' their hand and blurting something out, 'cause they're like, well where's the comment box? Where is it? And they weren't aware of the context
8:04
that it's a seminar room, there's real people. By just spending so much time online,
8:10
you try to act in the real world with the online rules, but that's not how it works. I would in all honesty attribute a lot of my success,
8:19
where I'm at today, due to social intelligence, learning how to read people. If you don't know this, you close off so many doors.
8:28
If you're at the bottom and you're starting out and you want to enter different scenes, or network your way up, or even, there's that famous quote,
8:35
surround yourself with the five people, those are the people who influence you the most, if you don't have the basic social intelligence
8:42
to create just no downside, you're not gonna move up at all.
8:47
And then of course in terms of reading yourself, and that's what I love about this one too, of course reading other people,
8:53
but then always turn the mirror around on you. Like, how am I doing this? What about me, what is running me?
Human Nature
8:59
- The most important law of human nature is that we deny that there is such a thing as human nature.
9:04
So I have chapters on all of these sort of primal forces that I believe govern us.
9:10
Our irrationality, the fact that emotions control us, the fact that we tend to be self-absorbed
9:17
and that we're all sort of narcissists. That we are prone to feeling envy,
9:23
constantly comparing ourselves to other people, that we have a dark side, that we have aggressive tendencies.
9:30
But when we think of these things it's always the other person. I'm rational and you're irrational.
9:37
I care about people, you're the narcissist. I'm a nice, wonderful person,
9:42
you're aggressive or passive-aggressive. I never feel envy, I don't really have a dark side.
9:49
We have a tremendous need, to feel of ourselves as being superior.
Understanding Yourself
9:54
Now I'm not trying to bum you out with this book or make you depressed, but I think,
9:59
by understanding yourself better, by understanding that you're not nearly as great as you think you are,
10:04
that you do have these tendencies, you actually can begin to change yourself.
10:10
The self-help genre is a huge genre, I'm definitely within it, but a lot of books, we read books
10:17
and they don't really lead to any kind of change, because they don't challenge us. They're not looking at the reality of who we are,
10:25
and I believe you can't change yourself, and can't get out of these bad patterns that you're probably locked into,
10:31
unless you actually look at who you are, you actually understand that you are subject
10:37
to many of these forces that I talk about. - Yeah, it's true, most traditional self-help books
10:42
that we read is all about positive thinking, or something that'll reinforce how good of a person I am.
10:49
We kind of scan through it, and we have that bias where you just block out things that challenge us. It's like, how amazing you are! Of course I'm gonna read that,
10:55
tell me how amazing I am, as opposed to, here's what's really goin' on beneath the surface. Do this in-depth audit on yourself.
11:02
Confront your inner demons, that's like, no! - But the beauty of the book, of what I'm trying to say
We Are All The Same
11:09
is that we are all the same, that nobody is exempt from this, that nobody is actually superior.
11:16
So it's not like you're worse than other people, it's just, this is who we are.
11:22
Because of our nature, because of how we evolved from millions of years ago, we have a tendency
11:27
to get caught up in the emotions of other people, viral effects, emotional contagion.
11:34
Why would it be that some people are exempt from that and others are not? No, we are all subject to these forces
11:42
and it's better to be realistic and look at it, than to be someone who's avoiding the truth or the reality.
11:48
I think too many self-help books try and compliment the reader.
11:55
Holding up a kind of idealistic image of who they are. I'm the opposite, I'm trying to show
12:01
that you're actually as screwed up as other people are and it's better to confront it and turn this around somehow.
Its Better To Confront
12:08
- Yeah, no that I absolutely love and it's what I talk about in a lot of my videos too. Confronting, as you'd call, like your shadow,
12:16
or Corleone, the shadow, like face those inner demons. Stop living in this state of denial with this split
12:23
inside of us where we're just like, I'm this acceptable me. No, own everything that is you and dive into that.
12:30
And then of course we have layers and layers of resistance to doing so, but as you said, until you do,
12:36
it's there either way, and it's active and running you, whether you're aware of it or not. So become aware, and then be thankful that you're aware
12:42
so then you can do something about it, which you talk about in your book here. - You do have aggressive tendencies,
Aggressive Tendencies
12:48
we all have aggressive tendencies, it's our nature and I explain why we have them.
12:53
And if you're aware of that, you can take that energy that we all have and actually channel it into something productive.
13:00
If you stop denying it, and you realize that you have this energy, you can turn it into being ambitious
13:06
and pouring that aggression into becoming something great, and to making something great, and to using that energy to fuel your persistence,
13:14
to push past any kind of adversity. To be aggressive when it comes to getting your way and getting what you want,
13:21
and I even talk about the positive aspects of anger and how to channel your anger into your work.
13:28
I use a lot of anger in my books, 'cause I am angry about people's hypocrisies
13:34
and the stupidity that we constantly confront, and I use that anger to fuel my writing.
13:40
But instead of getting angry at people and pissing them off and making a lot of enemies,
13:46
I channel it into my work, into my books. You can channel your anger and your frustrations into your work.
13:52
There's many ways to take that aggressive energy and make it productive but you won't do that
13:57
if you deny that you even have these tendencies. - Even reading that and seeing as you said that it's not just you, I think will also help relieve
14:05
a lot of self-attack or self-hate that we carry 'cause, it's really that resistance to say feeling angry,
14:11
'cause we're conditioned that way. It's like, don't feel angry! So then when you're angry, not only are you angry but then you're beating yourself up
Law of Rationality
14:18
and you're angry that you're angry, and you're angry that you're angry that you're angry, and when you see like, one it's part of who we are,
14:24
there's nothing wrong with you, you have a certain emotion for a reason, and two, this is everyone, it relieves a little bit of that angry
14:33
of feeling angry, of feeling angry. And then also just seeing the value in every emotion, it's there for a reason.
14:39
But what does eat us up inside is when we resist it too much and then it becomes this permanent state that we just live in.
14:46
You know, we can't escape it. And I love your first law too, it's that law of rationality, where even going back
14:54
to what we were saying before, learning how to read someone. If you don't dive into yourself, and confront what is running you,
15:00
you're gonna be projecting that onto the person and you won't even have the accurate data to read them.
15:08
An exercise that I love doing at some of my live events, say we've never met, we're just sitting here,
15:15
we're complete strangers and we're paired up in a group. Pick the person, without telling them, that you dislike the most.
15:22
Now you don't say it, everyone picks a person, and then you gotta ask yourself, what about that person, why did I pick that person?
15:28
What about them? And then dive into that, and you paint the picture. They're allowed to get negative, so it's like, you know what?
15:35
That person, they seem stupid, or that person, they seem like they're above the rest of the group, they seem like they know it all--
15:41
- You say this, you actually say this. - I'll paint out some examples, but then they say it in their head. They won't say it to the person, like, you!
15:47
And then throughout the seminar they get to know the other person, and they realize how off they were, and how it all came from them, and it's like, woh!
15:55
If that's what you're projecting, and then you're trying to calibrate and read the person based on that,
16:01
which has nothing to do with who they are, you're completely off, you know? - Yeah, look at it this way,
You Dont Understand The People
16:08
I'm trying to tell you that you don't understand the people that you're dealing with. You really don't know who they are.
16:14
You're walking around thinking that you know your wife, or your husband, your children, your boss, your friends,
16:21
but you really don't have a clue. You don't understand their experience, you don't really know
16:27
what they think of you actually, as well. Most of the time you're projecting onto them your own images.
16:35
Let's say you had a particularly bad relationship with your father, or your mother,
16:41
and you don't like people in authority because of the relationship to your father.
16:47
And so you meet somebody who's powerful, who has authority, and you hate them, you have a bad instant reaction
16:54
because you're projecting onto them some image from your own childhood. So you don't see the people that are in front of you,
Operating In Darkness
17:01
you're not seeing them, you're not understanding them. And what happens when you operate in darkness,
17:06
when you operate without knowledge, you make mistakes, you say something very stupid that offends the other person.
17:14
You don't even realize that you've offended them, and weeks later you notice that they're kind of cold,
17:19
and they're not responding to your texts and your emails, you have no idea why, because you probably did offend them in some way,
17:27
because you don't know who they are, you don't know their experience, you don't know what's going on inside of them
17:33
or what their likes and aversions are. So, if you stop for a moment and tell yourself,
17:39
damn, I don't know what the people around me are really thinking about me, it's a startling revelation,
17:44
and you're gonna wanna change that. - Just realizing this, you're like woh! Like how much we project and even how much,
17:51
going back to the state that runs us, also colors our perception. Say you're someone who's in a state of anger,
17:58
that's gonna color your focus, who you focus on. You're like, is it a little hot in here? What time is it, I'm a little tired, et cetera, et cetera.
18:05
If you're in a state of fear, you're gonna be like, do I look good, what are people thinking of me, it colors, literally what you see,
18:11
even looking at another person. You don't see them for who they actually are. I do wanna bring it back to reading other people,
18:17
and this what I loved. When you hear this, learn to read different queues, different dynamics.
18:22
Of course there's the classic body language, et cetera, et cetera, but then what I'll hear is,
18:28
look at the patterns that are running them, or when they're triggered, like what triggers them?
18:33
It goes that layer deeper of what is also running them? Not just the surface, but really piercing through
18:40
and understanding who they are, even linking it back to their childhood, so on and so forth. - So I'm trying to say that people have a character
People Have A Character
18:48
and what I mean by that is, it's their core, it's who they are, it's something very deep.
18:54
It comes from their DNA, there's a genetic component, it comes from their early childhood
19:00
and the kind of attachment they had to their parents, it comes from their early experiences with friends and teachers, and at school,
19:07
and it makes them who they are, and their character tends to be revealed in certain things that you must pay attention to.
19:15
And the reason it's so important is, you wanna be able to judge people by their character.
People Have Patterns Of Behavior
19:22
You wanna know what runs them from deep, deep within, because if you don't, if you make a mistake
19:28
you will hire them as a business partner or you'll get involved in a relationship, and it'll be a disaster because you didn't see,
19:37
that actually they have very negative patterns and they only come out later. So I want you to be able to look
19:43
at the people you're dealing with and literally see their character, and I give you some clues and tips on how to do that.
19:51
First of all, people have patterns of behavior. Nobody ever does anything once.
19:58
So let's say if somebody sent you an angry email that offended you and then they go,
20:03
oh, I'm sorry, but that's not who I was, something came over me, I'm not that person.
20:08
You will probably accept that but the truth is they never did that once, it probably is a pattern,
20:14
they've done it many times. If they've screwed you in some way they've screwed 10 other people in their past.
20:21
You wanna see people's patterns of behavior. That kind of compulsive element in them.
20:26
That'll show you something very deep in their core. You also wanna look at them
People Wear Masks
20:31
in the moments where their guard is down. We all wear masks, we all try to present ourselves
20:37
as being noble and great, but the mask comes down in certain elements.
20:43
You wanna look at how they treat their children, their spouse, their employees.
20:49
They might be nice to you because they want something out of you, but when their back is turned
20:54
and they're talking to other people, they're the biggest raging asshole around. That gives you signs if they're trying
21:00
to disguise this from you. But in the little details of life they reveal who they are.
21:07
You wanna see how they react under pressure. People under pressure reveal something elemental about themselves.
21:15
If they get hysterical, if they get prone to pointing fingers and blaming other people.
21:25
If people have power, if they suddenly gain power, if they're elected to an office or they're made manager or whatever,
21:33
they suddenly will reveal elements of their character. They will either become someone who's ugly
21:39
and power-hungry and manipulative or, which is much rarer,
21:45
they will reveal that they're very responsible, and they can handle power well.
Training The Reader
21:50
These are signs where people reveal, they almost ooze out of them, unconsciously,
21:57
of who their character is, of who they really are, and I want to train you, the reader,
22:02
not to look at people's appearances. Not to look at their smiles and the masks they wear and the compliments they pay you,
22:08
but to pay attention to these other, deeper signs that they are revealing of something much below the surface
22:15
that is actually going on inside them. Look at the little signs that people give off. If someone is habitually late,
22:24
they'll say, oh, it's traffic, or I had so much work to do, whatever.
22:29
But actually it's a sign that they feel superior to you, that they feel that their time
22:36
is more important than yours, and these little details that people are constantly giving out,
22:42
you see signs of who they really are, but you're not paying attention to them. - Another thing I love focusing on,
22:49
I know you talk about it too. Looking into the eyes, into the pupil and just seeing,
22:54
like of course you can tell on the surface if someone's a little bit more restricted, nervous,
22:59
but otherwise going even deeper and asking yourself, is someone even there? How present are they,
23:06
as opposed to retracted, into the mind, like not fully present, in their head analyzing,
23:14
just not there, and you're like, that's interesting. Or when they're you know, triggered, something takes over, what is there?
The Eyes
23:23
- Well, think of it in those moments in life when you're falling in love with someone,
23:29
and through their eyes, the eyes are really connecting in that moment, both eyes, sets of eyes are interacting, and there's a powerful,
23:37
powerful attraction going on through that, and the eyes, and that kind of looking and gazing,
23:45
and the pupils get dilated and there's excitement, it lights up the entire face.
23:50
The smile, the cheeks are raised, et cetera.
23:56
People give off these signs of excitement or detachment all of the time. So if you're trying to influence someone,
24:03
or if you're trying to seduce someone, you wanna be able to pick up those signs that you're having an effect on them through the eyes.
24:10
I talk a lot about distinguishing between a real smile and a fake smile.
24:16
A real smile lights up the whole face and it also lights up the eyes, and then you know
24:21
that you're connecting with that other person. Whereas that fake, tight smile that a lot of people have,
24:29
you know that there is no connection going on. - And building on that, looking at the smile,
24:35
but also when they smile and what topics, or dynamics turn them on, that too.
24:44
You can even test someone, and I know you talk about this, if you share some good news, how do they react?
Testing People
24:50
As opposed to some bad news or some gossip, what topics turn them on, and you can get a better reading
24:55
of what's running them, what's there? - Yeah, you can test people sometimes.
25:01
If you think that you're dealing with someone who's envious, or passive-aggressive, you can tell them
25:07
some particularly good news that you've had. There's a micro-expression, which is something that a lot of psychologists have documented like Paul Ekman,
25:17
which is half of a millisecond, where for a moment they're kind of friendly and then they put a fake smile up to disguise that,
25:25
and you can pick that up. They're not really happy about your good news. Or you tell them something bad that's happened to you,
25:32
you lost this job, your girlfriend left you, and you notice for a moment the happiness on their face
25:37
which they then try and hide by pretending to be sympathetic to you.
25:43
So you can test people, but also, you wanna notice those things.
25:50
So you're in a conversation with a person and you happen to touch upon a subject that excites them.
25:58
That's the kind of information that's extremely important to gather, and you can tell by the tone of their voice
26:06
and by the look in their eye, they reveal that. I know for myself, if people talk suddenly
26:12
about the Lakers, or basketball, I get really excited, I can't help it
26:17
because I'm such a basketball junkie. My whole body language changes,
26:23
but conversely if there's a subject that I really don't like to talk about, like cancer,
26:29
or some subject like that, my whole body language changes. You're missing these signals that people are giving out
26:37
in your conversation, but they reveal a lot about the likes and dislikes of these individuals
26:43
and how you can appeal to them. - And even turning the mirror around on you. Like when, if you're watching this, when do you light up?
26:50
And it's not about judging yourself. You may be watching this and you're like, man, I do light up when it's bad news, or when it's gossip.
26:57
If something comes up it's like (inhaling deeply) that's, it sounds weird to say, when I feel alive.
When I Feel Alive
27:02
I remember myself way back in the day, if I was hanging around positive people,
27:08
and say we're all jokin' around, I could fit in but it required a lot of energy and effort, and when I left that environment, I would feel drained.
27:15
I was like (deep exhale), now I can finally go back to me, and my friends where we gossip and stuff.
27:21
- Oh I see. That's interesting-- - The gossiping gave me energy. That's where I could feel at home,
27:26
as opposed to the positive people where it required effort. And then you can audit yourself there,
27:33
like now it's more so when I'm more positive I feel more energetic and alive, as opposed to the opposite.
27:39
So you follow what gives you energy? Around who do you feel at home? What topics do you feel at home?
27:44
- It says a lot about who you are. - Yeah, so then it's like turning the mirror, okay that's interesting, and without going on
27:50
this self-attack train it's like, well why is that? Diving into yourself, and I really love
27:56
how you keep bringing it back too, to our childhood, 'cause we always tend to ignore that. You hear advice like, always focus on the future, don't look back!
28:04
But if you don't look back you're gonna keep repeating the same patterns-- - Right, right. - You have to look back to do something about it,
28:10
to change the future. I know a lot of people have resistance where they're like, well, my childhood was great.
28:17
My parents were together, they're a loving couple, I had a great childhood, I don't have any of these frustrations or patterns that run me,
28:24
I haven't suffered any kind of childhood trauma, but no one is exempt from this.
28:29
And then it's really changing too, how small things impact us, 'cause our perception is just so limited and different as a child.
28:36
Even being lost in a grocery store could be traumatic. So everyone has this, and then it's really going back
28:42
and like, okay well, what did happen? What were my parents like? What did they value?
28:47
What got passed on to me? How was their relationship like? 'Cause I'll see that a lot, say your parents fight a lot.
28:55
As a kid you're gonna look at that and you're gonna form this core belief of that's what love is.
29:00
That's what a relationship is. And then you keep gravitating towards that in your adult life, 'cause that's at the foundation
29:06
of your map of understanding. Or if someone, your parents are divorced, you're gonna fall for people who leave you,
29:12
or who cheat on you, who are not there for you. And it's these constant patterns, and we refuse to dive back
29:19
and analyze why, and learn how to process that. So I love that you brought that in. - Everything that happens in the present,
29:25
I want you to look back and see the roots of it in your early past, and think of it this way.
29:31
When you were a child, you were extremely open and vulnerable, much more than you are now.
29:37
As we get older, we become defensive and walls go up, and we're more trying to protect ourselves from people.
29:45
But when you're a child you're extremely open and extremely vulnerable to the energy of the people around you.
29:51
Those first few months with your mother, if that's who you spent your first few months with, are critical.
29:58
So much of the energy from that mother was absorbed into your spirit, and creates patterns of behavior.
30:04
The same can happen with your father, and the same thing happens with your siblings. And so, I want you to examine this in depth.
30:13
In each of the chapters I go and show you the roots in your childhood. So for example, I talk in the book about,
30:22
let's say a boy whose mother was not really there for him, whose mother was kind of a narcissist,
30:29
and whom he almost had to pay more attention to her, to make sure he didn't hurt her, than she paid to him,
30:36
the reverse of the usual parental relationship. Well as that boy gets older,
30:42
he's gonna tend to project this onto other people. His greatest worry in life
30:48
is that people are going to abandon him, like his mother abandoned him when he was a child.
30:54
And so he gets into a relationship into his 20s, and he's with a woman,
31:00
and for a moment she acts in a way that's not so friendly or a little bit cold, and he immediately feels, oh my God,
31:07
she's about to abandon me, she's about to break up. And he gets hostile, and he initiates an argument of some sort, et cetera.
31:14
He never realizes this person, that the root of this pattern, of this animosity
31:20
or this antagonism with his partner, stems from a great fear that was embedded in him
31:26
in his early childhood, this fear of abandonment. And it constantly creates a pattern throughout his life,
31:31
over and over, and over again. He's the one that abandons the other person before they can abandon him,
31:37
so he doesn't have to deal with that trauma. Well there's all sorts of things like that that are embedded in you.
Your Childhood
31:42
Even if you think you had a golden childhood, nobody had as good a childhood as they believe,
31:48
because in retrospect you think everything was wonderful. But actually children are very insecure, are very vulnerable
31:59
and are constantly feeling emotions of fear, and anxiety and resentment, and anger and hostility,
32:07
that we don't realize later on, but they're very much within us. And so, your childhood contains keys
32:15
to who you are in the present, and not all of it's bad, some of it's really good. So I have a chapter in this book about discovering
32:23
what you were meant to do in life, your purpose in life, and the key to that is to see who you were as a child,
32:30
and what you were naturally drawn to, and what you were naturally repulsed to. The fields and the activities that excite you the most.
32:37
So your childhood also contains keys to who you can become. - One can even argue with the patterns
32:43
that nothing really changes, since your childhood, until you address it. On the surface, the physical world changes,
32:51
but it's those same patterns. The friends and the role you take on as a kid,
Patterns Of Your Childhood
32:56
you keep putting yourself in those same situations. If you're someone who is the class clown in the friends,
33:03
or the person who's at the bottom who people tolerate but they're not gonna go out of their way to see you, you think that when you grow up
33:09
or even you move, it'll change. Everything will change if I just move. But you just find your way back
33:14
in that same role, just with new people. You project your father and your mother on new people.
33:20
Your ceilings of success, when it comes to your health, your wealth, your relationship, you keep sabotaging
33:26
when you go above what you believe you deserve and it just manifests in all these different ways, so you think things are changing
33:32
but it's just this repeat of the same dynamics, the same trauma, so on and so forth.
33:37
And, I love what you said too, with when you're a child you're a lot more vulnerable.
33:43
And it's true, we fail to see that you're more vulnerable, you depend on your parents to survive or whoever is raising you,
33:48
'cause if they get rid of you you die, and your perception's very limited.
33:53
You don't know what the world is, or countries are. Even in a classroom, your world is the classroom.
34:00
If you don't fit in the classroom you think you're gonna explode, you know? And something as trivial as even a parent saying,
34:09
say you're at a restaurant, I love this example 'cause that was me. I remember, I was told, I don't remember,
34:15
that I was in this restaurant and I said very loudly, mom, is this dead cow? Like really loud, and everyone was staring,
34:21
and she was like, shh, don't say that. But even something like that, like shh! Be quiet in a restaurant, their intention is good
34:26
but then the way I interpreted that is, they don't love me right now. If they don't love me they could abandon me, I could die. Traumatic-- - Right--
34:32
- And then like we start, never be loud again, or in a classroom if someone finds out that you like a girl
34:39
and the whole class teases you, that's traumatic as well. And then we fail to look at that in our adult life where,
34:47
as you call it like being triggered. It's like, go say hi to this girl, that same experience, like that same
34:52
(groans) I'm gonna die if I do this that you had in your childhood surfaces, or speak up in public, or in front of a crowd,
35:00
(inhaling deeply) people can't do that. Public speaking is one of the biggest fears people have 'cause it goes back to that, and we try to find little tools
35:07
to fight against it instead of get to what you harp on a lot, get to the cause, get to the source of it all.
35:13
- Right, 'cause then you can possibly change it and then you can begin to break out of those patterns that you have.
35:19
So if you understand, that you are the one projecting this fear of abandonment or hostility
35:25
onto other people, then you can stop it. You can stop it and you could realize,
35:30
that that woman that you thought was about to abandon you was actually just in a bad mood or just was dealing with something else.
35:36
And then you can break out of this horrible pattern that's ruining your life, but you can only begin to do that
35:42
when you confront your own demons, when you confront these elements in your character
35:47
that are causing you to repeat, over and over again the same thing. One thing I want to do in this book,
Dont Take Anything Personal
35:53
and I think it can really liberate you, is to not take anything personal.
35:58
Now I know that sounds like an idea that's really difficult, because we're always taking something personal.
36:05
If someone says something and we get in an argument, or they say something that we perceive as hostile,
36:12
we assume that they're being personal, that they're attacking us, they're attacking us for who we are,
36:17
and we really are upset about it. But nothing is really ever personal
36:23
in the realm of social relations. Well not nothing, rarely is it.
36:28
So that when a person shows anger towards you, or resentment, or some kind of negative emotion,
36:36
95% of the time they are dealing with their own emotions, their own problems, their own traumas,
36:42
something from their childhood. So if you realize in that moment, that they are frustrated not because of you,
36:49
but because of the day that they were having, because of a phone call they had earlier in the day,
36:55
because of problems rooted in their childhood, it frees you up from getting resentful and angry,
37:01
and creating these spiraling misunderstandings. So if they are actually upset with you
37:09
because of something that happened earlier in the day and you take it personally, and you get a little angry,
37:14
you then make them have a worse one than they already had, then they say something worse, and then you get more upset--
37:21
- Just ping pongs back and forth-- - Yeah, it's a descending spiral here. So you wanna be able to break out of that,
37:27
you wanna be able to feel free and not take things personally. People don't mean it that way,
37:34
they're dealing with their own shit, their own problems. - No one can ever truly know you at all, except for you.
37:41
I can get a feel for you, but I don't know every experience you went through your entire life,
37:47
how it felt, how you interpreted it, how you experienced it, even your parents or your closest friends, no one knows that except for you.
37:54
So because no one has all the facts, they can't actually approve of you or disapprove of you,
38:00
'cause they don't know who you are. They can just speculate or project. And we take it as if they know everything that is us.
38:08
And then, even looking at them, another benefit as you say of looking past the mask,
38:16
is that we stop comparing everything that we know about ourselves with the surface front that we see.
38:23
'Cause like we see that, they're so perfect. I'm comparing that perfect front to all my baggage and everything about me,
38:31
self-attack, self-hate, spiral down. - It all stems from what we were talking about earlier,
38:36
where you're not really seeing the people around you. You're not really dealing with the reality,
38:41
you're dealing with an illusion. You're dealing with your own projections, and you're dealing with the mask that they present.
38:48
So, people are always showing their best side. They love their job, they have a great partner,
38:56
a great family, et cetera, and they tend to disguise the bad things, the depressions,
39:03
or the negative emotions that they're experiencing. And so you're feeling envy, you feel,
39:09
why God, my life isn't as good as their life? If only I had their childhood, if only I had their loving parents.
39:17
But you're not seeing the reality, and probably if you got closer to them,
39:22
if were inside their family and you saw how they interact with their children and their spouse,
39:27
you'd realize that their presenting to you this very idealized picture. It's not as rosy as it looks.
39:33
And then you don't have to feel envy, you don't have to compare yourself. I don't know if you've felt this,
39:39
you out there in the world, or you Julian, you're doing some project, you're doing some work,
39:46
you're writing something, you're creating something, and you get into this flow,
39:51
where your focus is so deep on the work itself, and you feel really light, and you feel really excited,
40:00
and there's no emotional baggage, you're just in the moment, dealing with this project and making it great.
40:06
And that's because, there's nothing personal going on, you're not dealing with issues with other people.
40:14
You're just focused on this, in a rational way,
40:19
and getting the project done. Well if you could approach social life in the same way,
40:25
where you have this flow, where people are just facts of nature, they just are who they are, they're not people that hate you
40:35
or love you, et cetera, they just have their own problems, their own issues, and it's nothing to do with you.
40:42
If you can get into sense where it's not about you and your emotions, you can feel that kind of light,
40:48
liberating feeling that you have in your work, where you're focused and things are just what they are.
40:55
It's a very light, liberating feeling. I think that we're all dealing with an illusion.
Imagine If
41:02
That we live in a world of illusion, that we don't really see the people around us, that we're not dealing with who they are,
41:09
we're dealing with this kind of mirage. And sort of the red pill moment is what I'm trying to give in the book.
41:15
Imagine if instead of this mirage, this illusion that you walk around with,
41:20
where people project these images that aren't real at all, imagine if suddenly you could see into who they really were.
41:28
If suddenly you could see behind the mirage, you could see what's really motivating 'em, you can begin to understand their thoughts
41:35
and their emotions, it would blow you away, and the world would completely change you.
41:41
Your whole vision of the world would change, and you would be fascinated by this, and you'd wanna do more of it,
41:47
you wanna see more and more and more, of what really lies underneath people. And I'm not saying I can do that completely in my book,
41:53
I don't wanna be so grandiose, but that's my goal in there, is to get rid of those illusions and that mirage that you have about people,
42:01
and actually begin to see who they really are. So I talk in the book, I have stories,
42:06
each law is illustrated with a story. And in one chapter I talk about this famous writer,
42:13
Anton Chekhov, who had a really, really horrible childhood.
42:18
His father beat him almost every single day. They lived in this miserable little village,
42:24
and they were poor, everyone in the family was fighting, the mother was really weak,
42:29
and the father was just really abusive. And then suddenly the family,
42:35
the father and his brothers moved to Moscow and they abandoned Anton at the age of 16,
42:40
to live by himself in this miserable little village where he can maybe finish his schooling.
42:47
And he starts to feel like insane amounts of resentment, and hostility towards his family.
42:53
Towards his father who beat him everyday, towards his mother who never stood up to him, and then at one point he realizes,
43:01
he's walking in the streets in this miserable little village and he realizes, what would happen to me if I suddenly got rid of all
43:08
of these negative emotions towards people that are obsessing my thoughts?
43:14
What if I really tried to understand my father, instead of hating him? And then he took a step back and he said,
43:20
"My father was born a serf" meaning he was basically a slave who was later freed.
43:27
"And his father beat him, "and his father made him go into a profession that he hated,
43:33
"so naturally he became an alcoholic, "and naturally he beat me, and he can't help it."
43:39
And as he went through that process, he felt waves of love towards his father,
43:44
like he could understand him, like he'd get inside his spirit, and he did the same with his mother.
43:50
His mother couldn't help being passive, because that's how she was brought up, et cetera.
43:55
And no wonder his siblings were so wounded by this childhood. And as he went through that process of understanding people and getting inside their story,
44:03
he felt this insane liberation from all those negative feelings
44:08
of hostility and resentment and bitterness, oh, why was I born into this family, oh, why did I grow up in this village,
44:15
and he realized it was all for a purpose and it was fine. And in going through that process,
44:21
he actually began to see his father for who he really was, not for this projection that he had,
44:27
and it completely liberated him from all of his negative emotions. So that's a bit of the kind of feeling I think you can have,
44:35
by going through some of these processes that I describe. - One of the practices that really helped me
44:41
shed a lot of light on what was running me, we all know like, if you have a disease, what would change?
Being Alive
44:48
What would happen if you found out, a horrible disease, like you have cancer, what would change? And immediately, there's less of that split,
44:55
that denial, where like wow! We start becoming aware of all this stuff that we just keep blocking off, or putting off.
45:01
And what we don't realize is that we do have a disease, and that's called being alive. None of us get out of here alive, we all die.
45:08
We could die tomorrow, we could die in 20 years, you could die in a week, you have no idea,
45:15
so just reflecting on that, brings a lot more authentic data and gets you much more aligned
45:20
with what is authentic to you, in my experience. - Well, it's kind of personal to me
45:26
because about three months ago I had a near death experience. I suffered a stroke, which you can see signs of,
45:33
I don't really have use of my left side of my body. And that stroke, if it wasn't for my wife
45:39
who was there next to me in the car I was driving, I probably would of died. I would've gotten in a horrible accident,
45:45
or I would've had irreparable brain damage right now. I came very close to dying, and it did shake me up
45:54
and it did alter, so I wrote that chapter, and it's a chapter I feel very strongly about.
45:59
But it was brought home to me in a very visceral manner. I remember I did a book with 50 Cent
46:05
that you interviewed me about, and 50 had a near death experience, much stronger than mine.
46:12
Somebody shot a gun, that distance, right through his mouth, through his jaw, and he took nine bullets, and he saw that proverbial light
46:21
as he lay in this hospital bed, that light that comes from, oh, I'm about to die.
46:27
And I notice that people like that, or even with myself, after that sense of experience,
46:34
there's a certain calmness that comes over you, like nothing really will phase you anymore,
46:40
because what could compare, what could be worse, than what you've already been through? So I have this feeling that the fact that
46:48
we live in a culture that's very avoidant of death, human nature is such, that even from primitive times,
46:54
we're the only animal that's aware of our own mortality. And it's had a profound impact on us.
47:01
It's part of what led to the creation of religions and the belief of an after-life, that we're all gonna maybe go to a heaven.
47:08
So we're very much afraid, deeply afraid of this feeling of death. And in our culture, it has a different form.
47:16
We don't maybe believe in the after-life but what we do is we deny death, very deeply.
47:21
We deny it's presence. We never see anybody who dies.
47:27
200 years ago you were around people in your house, or on the streets, you saw literally somebody die.
47:33
It had a very visible presence to you. You saw animals were being killed so that you could eat them, right?
47:40
Death had a presence. We have now banished it to hospitals, and to factory farms where chickens are slaughtered.
47:48
We never have to confront it, and when we watch movies, we see 100 people being shot with a machine gun,
47:55
but it's like a cartoon that has no reality. So we're living in a world, we are in deep, deep denial,
48:02
the fact that we are mortal creatures, and I believe that with that denial
48:07
comes a great deal of latent anxiety in your life. It makes you anxious and fearful
48:13
for a lot of little, smaller things in life, which is why, somebody's who's had a near death experience
48:20
gets rid of that anxiety and doesn't have that kind of avoidant mentality.
48:25
So I want to open up, we tend to turn our back towards death,
48:31
and I want you to turn around, and face it square in the eye, every single day.
48:36
It's not a negative thing, it's an immensely beautiful thing. First of all, you are alive,
48:44
you know you feel that you're alive, but by not realizing that you're dead,
48:49
that you contain inside of you your mortality, you're only half-alive,
48:54
you're only dealing with part of the truth. And so in Zen philosophy and Samurais,
49:00
they want you to connect with that death energy in your gut, in your heart, right here,
49:06
so it'll make you feel more alive. And then realizing that the people around you are going to die,
49:13
will make you connect with them on a much deeper level. I was recently in New York City,
49:19
and I was walking in the streets, and I saw all of these hundreds of people walking around me on 5th Avenue,
49:26
and for a moment I was imagining that all of these people are going to die at some point.
49:31
In 70 years not one single one of them will be around, and maybe I don't like them for this,
49:38
that or the other reason, but when I think about that fact, I have deep wells of empathy,
49:45
that they are also confronting the same reality that I am, and they're afraid and they're fearful of it.
49:51
So, confronting this mortality connects you to other people, and it also opens your mind up to something great.
49:59
I call this the sublime, and I think one of the things that really oppresses people in the world today,
50:05
is that our lives are so immersed in banality, in triviality, in the day-to-day grind,
50:11
and we have no sense of what is immense about the world. And death is the most immense, possible experience.
50:19
We have no idea what it is, it's like this great, vast darkness. And I say by confronting this thought of your own mortality,
50:28
you open your mind up to other realities. You open your mind up to the vastness of space and time,
50:36
that is quite an overwhelming feeling, to realize that some three or four billion years ago,
50:44
life began on this planet, and the fact that you are alive now is extremely, extremely lucky,
50:52
the set of circumstances that led to your being alive. These kinds of thoughts are sublime thoughts,
50:58
and they come from the fact that you're confronting your mortality, and you're opening your mind up to this much wider experience,
51:06
that when you're afraid, there's the anxiety-ridden and avoidant attitude that most of us feel.
51:13
So, confronting your mortality is perhaps the most liberating step of all
51:19
and is why I ended the book on that note. - Yeah, it's like the ultimate, confronting reality,
51:25
not the illusion, it's like, life and death. - Right, it's the ultimate red pill in that sense.
51:31
- Thank you so much. - I enjoyed it.


- It's Owen and Julien Blanc sitting here on Hollywood Boulevard and what we're gonna be
0:05
talking about today is the importance of what we call meta-level awareness and what that means is that
0:10
for most of your life, you're sitting there in your head trying to think about your problems, your life,
0:17
your bullshit and not putting enough emphasis on thinking what other people are experiencing. Now even when I say that, just in even saying that,
0:26
like 90% of the people just clicked off this video, they're like, oh shit, thinking about other people, ugh.
0:33
- Fuck that yeah. - Bleh! Right, but what you're not realizing is that the number one sign of a fucking loser, of a low status individual
0:40
is their inability to consider what others are experiencing and to kind of deal with that.
0:45
So what this video's gonna show you is actually how to increase your social status a huge amount, huge, believe me, and the way that we're gonna do it
0:54
is by showing you that getting out of your own shit for all of two seconds a day, all of a sudden,
0:59
your actual perceived status is going to shoot up. - Here in Hollywood, recording with this little--
1:07
- With Peter. - Peter from Family Guy, with the little bird. (mumbles)
1:13
Peter. - I'm gonna take it as a big compliment. - It is. What are we talking about in the video? - We're talking about social calibration
1:19
and getting out of your own bullshit, and hearing other people in such a way that will help your social status in a tremendous fashion.
1:24
- Boom, so we got an intro shot, but we now lost the light, so, brainstorming
1:31
for a good place to film. (crowd chattering)
1:40
- So I wanna ask you a question right now. Would you like to become one of those people where, whenever you walk in the room, everyone's like (gasps), it's Julien Blanc, oh my God!
1:50
Or would you like to be one of those people who's more like, yeah Julien's coming. I know, sorry right.
1:55
Which one do you wanna be? Now the reason I'm asking you this is because you may not be aware that this is really something that you
2:01
can influence so, so, so easily, when you just understand a couple simple things, and the reason that both Julien and I are very
2:08
passionate about this is the way that we built the company, a lot of time is through having great connections and insight through high level people,
2:15
and being able to get into venues that we like to go to. And they could be hard to get into,
2:21
and learning how to talk our way in. And from having different associates and different influences where really,
2:27
we're not rich at the time when we're coming up, we don't have a lot of social approval at the time that we're coming up, but the one thing that we do have is
2:34
raw social skill, okay, just raw social skill, so I don't care how broke you are, if you're not good-looking, whatever it is,
2:40
you have this one thing that you can choose to get down. So we're gonna be looking at it today from a standpoint
2:46
among many that we could be looking at but the standpoint that we're gonna be looking at is are you in a coping state of mind,
2:52
where you're just sitting there like it's all about me, it's all about me and people feel kind of a suck coming off of you or are you in a thriving mindset
3:00
where energy is just like ah, it's coming out. - Nice to meet you, man. (indistinct crosstalk)
3:06
I started the company like a year and a half. And now we play you guys at our sales meeting, it's like every week. Over a hundred people, crushing.
3:12
It's really awesome, yeah man. I really do appreciate everything you guys do. - I was having trouble with girls,
3:17
but one of my biggest things was just being present, in the moment, just being really, I've always been a fast thinker and a fast talker
3:25
and I've never been present in the moment and watching you like changes my life. - Thanks, man.
3:30
- So I started a solar company about a year and a half ago and now we're over 100 employees, (mumbles),
3:36
that's how I met with Todd, and honestly, it's been the biggest game changer for me.
3:41
- So the average person, whenever they're interacting with someone, they're typically thinking four things. The first is, say we're talking, how does this relate to me?
3:50
If you say something that just doesn't relate to me and I'm your average Joe, I'm just gonna block it off.
3:55
Just like, you know these chips here in this little vegan restaurant, if I'm not here (mumbles)
4:01
I'm just like, when is he gonna switch to something else that refers to me? When do we talk about me, my favorite topic.
4:09
Okay so how does this relate to me, number two, they're thinking, do I get it?
4:14
So if you're explaining something, as soon as it clicks, oh I got it, I'll just cut off the rest. You just don't listen to the rest.
4:22
Number three, when it is my turn to speak, and this one's huge and I've seen it, you've seen it too for years teaching guys
4:29
how to interact with women, they're just waiting for their turn to talk. What about me, what about me, when do I talk? Okay is she done, is he done?
4:35
Don't, okay, and number four, am I being tested? Did I pass the test? These are the four things that your average Joe
4:42
is thinking about whenever interacting with someone, thinking that it'll help that person maybe be higher value
4:48
or pass the test, when in reality it just lowers your value and people sense it immediately.
4:54
If you're actually their present, if we're talking you'll sense immediately if I'm listening to you or if I'm drifting off
4:59
like oh I got it. Oh you're talking about, oh me? You're just not there, you're just interacting with someone
5:05
through these filters and it just kills your value, it turns you into this very unlikeable person.
5:11
Yeah just this little pest. - You wanna try some experiment for one week and this experiment's gonna make you wanna
5:18
blow your brains out when you see it, watch different conversations that people are having
5:23
and what you're gonna see is that whenever you watch two people talking, you think of the two people interacting
5:29
kind of having fun and sometimes they are for sure, it definitely happens, as long as alcohol's involved it helps them do that, but one person's on the other person
5:36
and you can see that little hamster in that person's brain and they're continually going, what does this
5:41
have to do with me, so if you're talking about some kind of, we're in LA right now, and (mumbles) in LA,
5:48
rather than talking about the issue itself that's happening in LA, they're gonna keep bringing it
5:53
back to themselves, so we have a big rainfall a few months ago. Say like, yo the rain's getting crazy.
5:58
I'm like well, up at my place doesn't matter. Rather than just talking about the topic itself. Or say you're saying, oh the rainfall thing.
6:06
I'm just waiting for you to finish talking so I can give my opinion on the rainfall. Like you know what, here's my opinion because I don't
6:13
actually wanna listen or let the other person talk or maybe I feel like it's some kind of test,
6:18
like a self-qualifying thing, like I've got that under control. - Or you try to top it with a story.
6:24
Like you hear a story like hey, I bought this new thing, and I'm like, how do I pass the test? You know what I bought, or oh I get that you experienced
6:31
LA the rainfall, but you know, up in Seattle or in Switzerland, you wouldn't imagine the rain.
6:36
My rain beats your rain, no big deal. - Yeah yeah yeah and the funny thing with that one is like say two people are talking,
6:43
the general purpose of conversation socially is to elevate mood so people who are not cool
6:48
may think the purpose of conversation is a test or a self-qualification. - To win. - To win.
6:53
So people that are cool, they view it like, it's to increase the emotion, so you'll be like yo the rain here is crazy, and then I said,
7:00
dude you haven't even seen rain, man, okay? In Switzerland it's super crazy, this is nothing,
7:06
and then you're like, and it sucks the energy out of the conversation, you're like, wah wah wah.
7:11
Like okay well then good for you, you saw more rain than me. Great. And then the vibe's not going up so what you have to
7:20
understand is that this comes back to coping versus thriving and so somebody who's in a coping mode,
7:26
they tend to feel more like what does this have to do with me, what's the test here, when can I talk?
7:31
- Defensive, just very defensive, yeah. - Versus when you have somebody thriving, here's the key.
7:37
The underlying assumption is, I'm finding a way. I don't even need to have this conversation,
7:43
'cause I have what I need in life. So I'm having this conversation to amuse myself, there's nothing that I need to get out of this,
7:49
or to pull out of it, everything's chill, I'm good, but rather how could I increase the vibe, and so the example that I've taught it before,
7:57
you'll hear me say this in videos probably 'til I'm dead, is with coping versus thriving, whatever I say,
8:03
I'm rushing to the airport, and I get into an Uber or taxi, the Uber might say, "How are you doing?"
8:08
And I'm always like, "Good." Like it's about me, it's just like good,
8:13
like I'm too fucked up or say you just had a breakup or something really messed up just happened, they're like, "How are you doing?" You're kinda like, "Good," because there's--
8:21
- Thank you. - There's too much, there's too many different mental faculties being absorbed
8:26
to be able to absorb it, like if you take that guy who just put the plate down right in front of the camera there,
8:32
these guys running around here frantically, he's in coping right now, he's like, I gotta get them the brussel sprouts, I gotta get to this, he's probably not too thrilled
8:38
to be doing this kind of work. Maybe, maybe not. But in addition to that, the last thing he's thinking of is like am I disrupting anything when I slam down
8:45
(mumbles) even when we're recording, it's not even like dissing the dude. Just like, he's busy.
8:51
So that's a great example just happened right then and there right where everything in your life's going awesome, you're not in some major rush,
8:57
maybe you actually are like well this finger they're staring at right now, maybe I should just slam a brussel sprout in front of it.
9:03
- Or people kind of in front of the shots, like if you shoot in a busy street like say New York and you see people rushing to work,
9:09
right in front of the camera, shameless. Then you'll see someone like maybe on their vacation, touristy just taking their time and they'll see the shop,
9:16
be like, oh, let me walk around. First there's fuck this, usually walk around, I'm rushing, yeah.
9:23
- Yeah something we see all the time. So that being the case, when you're in thriving, you don't think I'm in a good mood and the Uber driver says
9:29
how are you doing, I say, oh great man, how are you doing? Because I'm good so now I'm gonna be more focused on him.
9:36
If you're watching this in a mode right now where you're not feeling super great, the last thing you wanna hear is me or Julien be like,
9:42
yeah, care more about other people, you're like, dude, I'm in fucking coping. The last thing the waiter wants to hear is like every time you put a plate down,
9:48
look at where you're putting it, he doesn't give a fuck, he just wants to finish his job. What I say to you to bait you in a little bit
9:54
is that if you get this down, your social status will actually increase and you won't have to worry about
10:00
when's my turn to talk or is this a test or how does this affect me or those things,
10:06
because you'll just be so good at life that none of this stuff will even matter to you anymore, but weirdly by having it matter, you're kind of like
10:12
in this weird spiral, it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy like this weird loop that's self-reinforcing,
10:18
where your social status is lower versus when you can break out of this, your social status will actually go up.
10:23
- And you'll feel more energized. Like you think if you're in that Uber situation, 'cause I've had it too where I'm really tired,
10:29
I'm like ugh, do I wanna spend the energy talking back but not just talking back, asking, how are you doing,
10:35
what if he talks more, what if he asks me more questions, it's draining but in reality that concern,
10:40
oh how does this relate to me? Will I have to talk more, is even more exhausting than just letting it come out and actually asking the person
10:48
how are you doing as well. - So we just came up to our new friend's house who we just met on the street. You guys cool with us putting in the video when you came out?
10:55
So we tried to be spontaneous, so he posted on Instagram stories and they came up to say hi,
11:00
then they're like, yo we got a cool place up in the crib, so we just came up and we thought if we shot the video here it'd be spontaneous. The basic thing that I learned and this goes for
11:07
social skills but it also goes in marketing, I mean this goes everywhere, is that,
11:12
you gotta stop having a continual focus on your shit, and you gotta get out of that.
11:19
So one of my great marketing mentors, it was John Carlton, he had a book called Kickass Copyrighting Secrets of a Marketing Rebel, and the big lesson that he'll give
11:26
in that is that the average person is so caught up in their shit and what's going on with them that they can't
11:31
market effectively. So Eben Pagan even talks about this too in his marketing stuff where somebody will love a flower shop
11:37
and they'll wanna name it James's Flowers, and then you say well what is the feature or benefit
11:42
that the client would get out of that from James's Flowers and they're like, my name is James,
11:48
and this is my flower shop and this shop is about me and my life and my journey to create the flowers, right,
11:57
so Eben Pagan used (mumbles) called Double Your Dating under the pseudonym David Deangelo, and so he made his title
12:02
Double Your Dating, and so it had a value proposition basing.
12:09
So sometimes Eben, his real name is Eben Pagan, he's married now and sometimes Eben will be trying to
12:14
help somebody in their marketing and it's like, say for example that we had your program right,
12:20
instead of calling your latest program Transformation Mastery, we would call it Julien's Journey.
12:27
So we're gonna ask you to pay hundreds of dollars-- - For the story of me. Watch me transform.
12:34
Julien's personal transformation and every detail about me. - You can express yourself, right.
12:40
So it's not like yo, we're gonna show you how even though right now you're stifled and fucked up,
12:47
your life could look like this and this and this and this and you could feel like this and this and this. No no no no no. Forget all that, this is about Julien and his journey.
12:56
Now Julien's journey is good within the context that you can see parallels to your life,
13:02
and if you're seeing parallels to your life, you're like, damn this fucking wow, this is amazing.
13:08
Hearing about your journey was so inspiring, Julien. If you can correlate that back to your journey
13:15
and your life, so even I'll have videos where I'll do a two hour story about my life but I'll keep bringing
13:20
it back to the principles that I learned which are transferable to you.
13:26
Now John Carlton also teaches this, he says what is everybody's favorite word? You.
13:32
So any time for example that we're speaking, like some people in YouTube videos for example, a lot of people start their YouTube videos,
13:38
they go hey guys, or like hey everyone. No no no no no no no.
13:44
This is not fucking hey everyone, and I realize a lot of major YouTubers do it like Jenna Marbles
13:49
or whoever does that but if you're gonna get gangster here you wanna be straight up, it's like, what's up, it's Owen and what we're gonna teach you today is this.
13:59
We're not coming at you like okay guys. Okay guys, no, you, it's you.
14:06
And we're gonna smash that in there and the reason why is because everybody's favorite word is you,
14:13
or their own name. They even teach some marketing where they'll actually have little algorithms where in an email,
14:19
it'll have a little algorithm where if you put your first name and say Julien Blanc, then what you'll have is,
14:26
it'll say Julien Blanc, ooh hoo hoo. Would you like to learn the secret of yada yada yada?
14:32
Now when we make these videos for you, great, because we are gonna make the video for you.
14:40
So from that context, you could just soak it up, mm, this video's all about me, great, awesome right.
14:46
But for your own social skills, you gotta learn how to get out of your own shit and actually be aware
14:54
of what the other person's experiencing, and many people simply have not taken the time to really,
15:01
really, really, really consider what is this other person experiencing?
15:07
Now, you gotta be careful with this because some people are so caught up in getting approval that they're like,
15:13
all they think about is what the other person's experiencing but it's kinda this weird way where they're kind of tiptoeing around them and they're afraid of them
15:20
and they're chasing their approval and that's not really good either because now the other person just weirded out, but we're speaking
15:25
about it from the context of studying what that other person's subjective experience of life is
15:31
and how you can bring value to that. - Well even in that context, they're aware, but to get approval it's still about them.
15:39
I'm aware of the other person so they can approve of me so it reinforces I feel good about me, me, me. So it's still sucking, trying to get for them,
15:47
versus I'm trying to get a feel for the other person so I can give, it's still like that taking vibe.
15:53
But no this is super key, shifting your focus outside of your head 'cause that's really like the four concerns,
15:59
like when it is it my turn to talk? Is it a test? When are they gonna talk about me, it's you, you, you, to what's the context, whether it's the person,
16:06
whether it's a group, whether, and this is super common, for example, during a seminar, when someone asks a question.
16:13
You see it immediately, it's like what's the context? You're here in a big crowd, someone's speaking
16:18
and you're asking a question. And I see it more and more throughout the years, people just don't get the context that it is a seminar,
16:26
they raise their hand and it's either a question that's unique to them and no one else can relate
16:32
or they talk way too long and at first, everyone's like, oh what's your question, it's like, hey so,
16:37
when you talk about this and they go into their life story. When I was five and I could really relate,
16:42
and everyone's like, and they just don't sense, for example, the vibe's just getting sucked out of the room.
16:48
It's like okay this person's going on a little too long because they're in their little head, their little story.
16:54
I see it too when I give an answer. If it doesn't really hit on, there's what you want,
17:00
there's what you need. If it doesn't hit on what they want and I'm giving them what they need, they just block it off, waiting to ask the next question.
17:06
Yeah it's absolutely crazy, so shift your focus and always ask yourself what is the context?
17:11
What is the context and what is appropriate to the context? And every time you do something that's not appropriate
17:19
to the context, you're gonna suck the air out of the room and in some examples, whether it's like a question in
17:24
an audience, another one is if you make a joke. Say I make a joke right now and you laugh,
17:30
on the other side of your screen, on your cell phone, you laugh and then I just stop the video, I'm like by the way, you do get why this is funny right,
17:37
it's because this equals this. Just adding that at the end, you're like, okay, you just killed it, that's when you're not aware
17:46
of a certain context, so shift focuses and then it's pattern recognition, it's trial and error,
17:52
put yourself out there and instead of just blindly just going through the motions, only focusing on you,
17:57
do something, say something and then look at what happens and then get a feel, oh when I say this,
18:04
the person reacts this way, when I say this, that person reacts this way, in this context, the person reacts this way
18:09
and this context person reacts this way. When I feel this, the person reacts this way, and like really make everything conscious.
18:15
Get a feel for it and then once you get a feel and you make the appropriate tweaks, you can make it unconscious again.
18:22
But this is something you have to do and one point that I do wanna add here is when you hear this
18:28
and this is a question I get a lot too, you hear us talk about breaking out of social conditioning.
18:33
It's like stop giving a fuck, and then, you hear advice like this where it's like do give a fuck.
18:38
- Give a fuck. Care so much that you study their every thought and learn how to connect to where they're at.
18:44
- Every fucking detail. - But don't give a fuck. - And the subtlety lies in are you letting this
18:51
basically confine you, are you letting it affect your self-worth and you're completely stifled,
18:57
for example, if you go out in a restaurant, a lot of people are very scared of even speaking up,
19:03
or even to the waiter. The waiter comes like, can I have some water please? Okay, you're being quiet there 'cause you don't have
19:09
a choice, you're affected by the environment, you're affected by whatever conditioning is there. Here what we're talking about is don't be attached to that
19:18
so your self-worth is attached to whatever the context is so if you want to speak loud, you can,
19:23
and then it's coming from a place of choice. You're aware of the context, you're not imprisoned by it
19:28
and then you choose to act in the way that's appropriate so people can relate, so people can get you
19:33
and you don't come off as someone who's, again, sucking the air out because you're too say, quiet or too loud, 'cause that'll happen too.
19:42
And less and less people have this. Especially with the internet where you spend most of your time now behind a computer screen, on your cell phone,
19:50
I mean yeah, you can link into seminars. If you watch a webinar or a video like this there's the comment box here below.
19:56
So whatever comes to mind, you're like at two minutes and 30 seconds, look at what happened, ha ha, like that where you're just like, so like,
20:03
webinars, the same thing, it's like UFOs, dick pictures, like all this random shit and then you attend a seminar
20:10
and instead of like quietly sitting there like here's the context, I'm here with a bunch of people, I'm not alone. You just raise your hand and blurt out shit,
20:17
like where's the chat box? Where's the real life chat box? - I was actually at the Tupac Shakur movie yesterday
20:23
and there was this dude, crazy man, like he just couldn't help just being like,
20:28
yo, tell 'em Pac, and it's just like (chuckles). I mean it made the movie more entertaining to be honest
20:34
but it was like, yeah. - You don't see like there's a bunch of other people here, what's appropriate?
20:40
Yeah less and less people have it. You don't learn it, you don't socialize,
20:48
you act basically in the real world thinking you're in the internet world, like the rules that are online in the real world
20:53
then it just doesn't compute. - What I want you to do is I want you to watch in yourself when you're able to do this
20:59
and when you're not and then you'll be able to detect it in other people so the example that I love giving
21:04
is I wake up and I've gotta catch a flight, right, so idiot that I am, I've been packing 'til too late,
21:11
packing my supplements and like packing my clothes and all this and getting ready to go and so I get to bed at like five in the morning
21:18
if I'm lucky, maybe like eight in the morning and I gotta leave for the flight at 11, so I wake up on about three hours sleep
21:24
and I feel like my face is being kicked in like some person is beating me in the face and I'm just like get up.
21:30
I'll go out to the Uber, and the Uber of course, thank god since taxi cabs there's no accountability
21:35
'cause there's no five star thing, with Ubers, usually they're like, "How are you doing, sir? "Good morning."
21:41
And if I'm that tired, immediately, I'm just like, I actually feel like, I'm almost mad at them
21:48
for even asking, like how are you doing, and I'm like-- - Why are you talking to me? - Yeah yes, leave me alone, and so I'm just like, fine.
21:56
Like 'cause my whole thought process is like in poor me and so I'm like, "Good.
22:02
"Good," and-- - Where's the request silence button? - That'd be awesome. - Right.
22:08
Dave Cook talked about it, it's true, it's like, in the app you're like request silence. It's like don't talk to me.
22:14
Actually be a great update. You're tired, it's like (clicks). - Yeah just say fuck off. 'Cause you might as well say fuck off.
22:20
So okay-- - Fuck off feature. - So basically what you have is I wake up, if I'm exhausted, "How are you doing sir?"
22:28
"Fine," or like, "Good," or like, not even like say good but just like, "Okay,"
22:35
and first of all, dude, when that person said how are you, he doesn't need to hear you say shitty.
22:41
At that point you couldn't even contain your own shit not to go, "Shitty," right, now, some people funny enough,
22:47
they'd say, well if you're being real and authentic than you should just say you feel shitty, like if you wanna say shitty but then you put a
22:53
positive spin on that maybe or something like that, it's interesting, but you gotta remember, who's it about? When that Uber driver says, "How are you?"
23:00
he's just trying to increase the vibe. From there what you have is when I wake up, alert,
23:07
and so the guy's like, "How are you doing?" and then i find that I'm filled with so much energy, I'm thriving so much, when I'm really thriving,
23:13
I'll start cracking up the driver. I'll start making jokes to the driver, cracking him or her up, joking around, having fun,
23:21
sharing, right, if we're sitting here right now, we're having a fun, nice evening, it's good to meet you guys, I've got my team here, everybody's having fun.
23:28
We wanna share, and then you're watching this at home and then you get to soak that up, you know if you're watching on your phone, whatever,
23:34
you get to soak that up and so it's like good feeling, right, as opposed to if we just turn on the fucking thing like today's shitty, which she might like sometimes,
23:42
maybe it switches it up, a little bit of an unexpected video, but you don't want that as the norm all the time.
23:48
So coping versus thriving. When you're in coping, you don't have the mental bandwidth
23:54
to think about the other person's experience. So when the other person's talking, either A,
23:59
you're just waiting for your turn to talk, B you're waiting just like, how does this affect me? Like what's my outcome on this?
24:07
Or you feel like they're testing you or whatever it is. So this is the first one my mother ever taught me. My mom didn't teach me a lot of heavy duty social skills
24:13
but she taught me this and it was actually something I never forgot as a kid, so my mom came to me one day and she's like, "Look, Owen, I got this shirt on sale.
24:20
"What do you think I paid?" And in that moment I'm thinking I'm being tested, I'm like, she said it's a sale, so that means it's cheap,
24:29
so I should just say really low so I don't look dumb. So I'm like, "Three bucks," and she says,
24:35
"Owen, when people say it was on sale, what did I pay, "just guess a little bit high and then when I tell you
24:42
"it's lower, then the emotions go up." She knew that I guess, so the idea that being
24:48
look at the two different examples here. Julien, I just got my new old man rainbow shirt,
24:56
on sale! What do you think I paid? What do you guys think I paid on sale?
25:03
So pick really low. - [Man] Two bucks. - No.
25:09
It was still $120. - Womp womp. - And what would you say?
25:14
- [Man] It still looks good. - Still cool. - That's really expensive for what it is.
25:19
- Yeah that's the thing right? - I'm just kidding, yeah. (chuckling) Then you double down, that'd be like (makes clicking sound).
25:25
Well that's what people would say, yeah. - It was still a good deal. - They just shut you down like, no that's really expensive like oh my god you should have gotten that for cheaper.
25:32
What are you thinking? Look at this website, you could get it here for cheaper. Just shouting out. - I remember one time I got a new apartment,
25:39
it wasn't even like super expensive but I guess it was more expensive than my buddy had, and so he's like, "What do you pay for this?" and I said $2900 a month,
25:45
and he's like, "Dude, I would never pay $2900 "a month for this," well why does he say that? He's more in coping so he's making it about him,
25:53
'cause now what's happening is, he's looking at it and then he's saying, I'm feeling shitty that I can't
26:00
afford $2900 a month and then I'm questioning myself, would I even need a place like this?
26:06
And then what's happening is his emotions are going down, and then he's dragging me down into his role,
26:11
like at best, at best at that point, what's the best outcome, the optimal outcome at that point
26:17
is oh well in 11 months, I'll secure a better rent pay
26:23
and yeah you're right, I never should have got this place. So, the difference is like, just to sort of heavy handedly
26:33
berate this example, if I say, "I got this on sale. "What do you think I paid?"
26:39
And then you're like, "$250," and then all of a sudden, I go, "No, $120," and so emotions go it's on sale,
26:47
guess what I paid, $250, no $150, wow great deal, so emotions going up and up and up.
26:54
So in thriving, the metaframe, the word metaframe,
26:59
do you guys know if that's NLP? Maybe you guys know. I don't know, we call it neuro-linguistic programming, so I think the word metaframe's from NLP,
27:06
I'm not sure, but the idea of the metaframe is that there's an underlying meaning to it. There's an unconscious subcommunication,
27:13
so typically the underlying communication, when you're viewing it as a test or waiting for your turn
27:20
to talk or making it about you is you're in coping, so you're a low status person.
27:26
And therefore people get negative emotions from you on two levels, one is that you're saying all this shit, making it about you, dissing the price of their rent
27:34
or whatever so they're not liking what you're saying, but it's also hitting them on another level which is that people wanna be around other
27:40
high status people. When you have high status, you walk down the street and people say, not to like, be weird,
27:46
"Come in my house and shoot in it." And when people have low status, people say, "Here's a quarter, go away," or not even have a quarter,
27:55
just, "Go away." It's like they say the hungry don't get fed, meanwhile if Leo DiCaprio walked into the restaurant
28:03
that we were in today, he'd probably get a free meal for eating there, when ironically he doesn't need it, he'd have girls trying to fuck him,
28:10
when he already has too many girls trying to fuck him, meanwhile a guy who's broke either isn't let in the restaurant and no girls wanna fuck him
28:16
even though he needs sex and he needs food very badly, so you wanna be in that upward spiral where even things
28:22
that you don't need people are offering to you, so if there's an underlying metaframe of coping that's there
28:28
not only are you saying things that would be perceived to the other person as potentially negative or it's not very uplifting, but also they don't feel like
28:35
they're around somebody of status which kinda takes away that halo effect that somebody of status has,
28:41
and so you're getting hit on multiple levels and so fundamentally you gotta make a decision that you gotta work on yourself to where you're okay
28:49
both in terms of actually making your life okay on the outside, but also shifting your inner perspective
28:54
to feel good on the inside starting right now. - It's also valuing feeling good and just talking
29:00
or say interacting with someone with the purpose of just feeling even better.
29:05
'Cause we come at it very logically, it's like, what do I get out of it, what's the point? Just feeling good, that's it, like one mission I used to
29:14
give guys all the time when it comes to, say, going out and interacting with girl is, go out one night and go out with your friends.
29:21
Usually you go out with your wing man, your buddy you're gonna go talk to girls with, go out with that friend. Sit at a table in a bar and for the whole night,
29:29
say you go out at 10, 10 to two, that's four hours, don't get a single drink and don't talk to a single girl,
29:35
just sit there with your buddy and see if you can just chat and shoot the shit and most guys just wouldn't be able to.
29:42
- Well you had the thing you used to do when you would teach live events for successful women where sometimes you see guys who only would wanna talk to
29:48
women that they're really attracted to and you spent two of the three days making them talk to women who they weren't into,
29:55
can you explain the rationality on that? No one will ever wanna attend your program ever again now but there was a point.
30:01
- No well they go hand in hand, just vibing, like shooting the shit, getting out of this logical,
30:07
what can I get? You're there with your buddy, there's nothing you can get. You're just stuck there and most guys would not be
30:13
able to shoot the shit, they'd be like, "So, "I can't fuck you. "How's it going I guess?"
30:19
And they just can't generate that. And it's the same with-- - So they're not getting something out of it. They can't even muster the will to--
30:26
- You're not getting anything. If you've got a dick why am I even talking to you type of thing-- - Like the Uber thing,
30:32
I'm tired, he says, "How are you?" Why would I say how are you back? - Yeah what are you gonna get out of an Uber driver. And that's why I even say, you just stay at the table,
30:39
not talking to girls 'cause if there's, say, some goal, you two can shoot the shit talking about a goal
30:45
'cause you know you're getting something out of that goal. When there's no goal and you're just stuck there, can you vibe?
30:51
And it's the same reason I would tell guys who only wanted to interact with girls they found attractive, I'm like hey,
30:56
talk to the girls you're not attracted to as well, learn to see the value in that even though,
31:01
yeah you might not be attracted sexually, you can still shoot the shit and build positive emotions.
31:07
- Yeah and what you're trying to do there is-- - Taking-- - Well you're trying to get them from coping to thriving
31:13
because ironically, for the first two days, they're talking to girls they're not attracted to,
31:18
what happens, essentially they're forced to start just having fun with people and then what happens
31:24
on the third day when you let them talk to the girls they're into? - (claps) Kill it, immediately. That's usually when you go from like an intermediate
31:31
to an advanced. You go through that phase where you have to learn how to have genuine fun talking to everyone
31:37
and stop judging them and thinking about the outcome all the time. And it links where you're saying before,
31:42
it's like if you are thriving, you don't need anything. You have your shit fucking handled. It's like your shit's so handled you can afford
31:49
to let that pour over onto the other person, and that's what you do, it's like you talk to everyone, you feel amazing and then you go to that girl
31:56
you're attracted to, how's it going, boom, she gets the good vibes, good emotions, you just hit it off, first is scanning,
32:03
closed off defensive like why would I talk to her? What do I get out of that? Would I get something out of that,
32:08
why would I talk to this person? You're just judging, it's just, again it's coping, yeah kinda sad reality.
32:16
And it's also understanding that the more you give, even in terms of say selfish needs here,
32:21
the more you give, the more you get. And it's not like must conserve resources-- - Because the hungry don't get fed,
32:26
versus Leo DiCaprio will, did you guys say he's your neighbor? (man talking indistinctly)
32:32
Cool okay so basically, Leo DiCaprio, it's like, "Leo, come in, here, take the food, Leo,"
32:40
versus the guy who just can't get a frickin' dime to save his life. If you're in a mode where you wake up in the morning,
32:47
like, try this an experiment, okay, you just look at your hands for a second.
32:52
You guys can even try this back there if you want to. Look at your hands, look at all the little, you do this too, why not?
32:58
Look in the light, look at the weird fucking lines in your hand there, look at the little micro hairs
33:05
that you never noticed or like little lines in your skin here, for me freckles that you never noticed,
33:10
and even just try like touching your hand like a masturbatory way. - So smooth and perfect.
33:16
- Yes, yes. (chuckles) - Young skin, young flesh. - This is how I get Aaron to do this with me in the morning
33:22
without looking inappropriate. - Just do this with us. - Okay do it with us. - Just pet your hand.
33:27
- Touch it, touch your hand. It's not gay if it's just to learn about self-help, just touch it now.
33:33
And so (chuckles). Look at the fire here for a minute and observe the fire
33:41
and kind of let that in and just like enjoy the fire for a minute, maybe Aaron if you want, you could just pop the camera.
33:47
Just pop the camera over here for a second and look outside at the beautiful view.
33:52
So now you're seeing downtown Los Angeles, it's kind of like the most beautiful, you can even pop outside for a second if you want to,
33:59
in some ways the most beautiful city in the world, I love it, in some ways like a third world country, it's a mix, let's not focus on that.
34:05
I'm sure you guys (mumbles). So then (chuckles). So just look at the beauty of that.
34:13
Take a deep breath right now, take a deep breath with me. (exhales slowly)
34:19
Just take a nice, deep breath, just look deep in my pupils right now.
34:24
Okay it's not gay if it's for self-help. So just keep looking deep (chuckles) right now
34:30
if you're a girl, just hit me up on Instagram, I'd love to hear from you. And it's not sex with a weird guru if it's for self-help,
34:39
so just talk, okay, as you can see, and that is how you get gratitude.
34:45
Essentially your mind has to shift into being grateful for what you have going for you right now, okay?
34:53
'Cause you could think, I don't have this, and I don't have that, I need better food
34:59
and I need to have a better life. I need a Lamborghini and knowledge right now.
35:06
You can make the choice to focus on what you don't have, or you can focus on what you do have. Now, as you're focusing on what you do have,
35:14
you're feeling really, really good, and now, you don't need to get something out of somebody.
35:21
Now as you don't feel like you need to get something out of somebody, the metaframe shifts to where
35:27
you're the cool person and then they begin to seek your approval, so you go from being like a black hole
35:33
to the sun emanating out, and that doesn't mean that you need to start pandering to them
35:39
and over complimenting because really that's about taking. When people say be yourself, the translation that means
35:47
to me is like enjoy your fucking life and feel good and enjoy the fucking cool
35:52
that is your short fucking life and then share that with others as you, as yourself.
35:59
That's what it means to me, it doesn't mean be yourself like be all fucking negative and fucked up
36:05
and then talk about your toxic shit. - With the state of gratitude too, by the way, this is huge, be aware of how you're conditioned
36:12
just with mainstream media and social media. It's like we buy into, for example, Instagram,
36:18
you'll go on Instagram and you're like, how can I be grateful when this person is doing this and this and this and their life is so amazing
36:24
and look at how they look, although they have a filter and it's been photoshopped, look at how they look versus me,
36:30
and you just focus on everything you don't have and you turn on the news, you look at everyone just getting
36:36
fucked over, all the horrible things happening. This person's being oppressed and that person's being oppressed and you're like
36:41
oh my god, and it just conditions you to not be grateful, to complain, to the point where you could be,
36:47
link it to success with women, out in an amazing club, let's just say in Los Angeles, one of the top clubs
36:54
with cool people, surrounded by cool people, there's music, there's lights, like everything there is designed for you
37:01
to have a great time and you're just sitting there just feeling horrible, just trying to take to feel better.
37:06
Ah fuck this, I need this, I'm missing this, versus, whoa, take a second and actually take it in.
37:12
Here I am in fucking Los Angeles, oh my god. This is something, yeah, even Instagram
37:20
will take that away from you if you buy into that. Like focus on complaining, focus on what you don't have, how about focus on what you do have.
37:26
- Or look at Instagram and thinking it in terms of lack rather than possibility. That's why I like Todd's stuff because some people
37:33
look at it in terms of lack, like I don't have that Lamborghini. When I see it I'm thinking in terms of possibility, I'm like, dude, that's so sick that you did that.
37:41
- Yeah, lack versus possibility, and this is something I do every single day, just reflect back on your life, where you are now
37:49
here today versus say yesterday, the day before, and shift your perspective to, just say reading books,
37:56
even reading dark and horrible books, and this sounds kind of fucked and morbid but say you read Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl,
38:03
the most horrible things ever, but it really puts you in your place with the shit you're complaining about.
38:09
We have such first-world problems. I saw it today just at the grocery store,
38:14
some lady was yelling at the person who was bagging her groceries 'cause she didn't bag it correctly
38:20
and she was being charged, what is it, five, 10 cents for an extra bag. And she's like, why's this here, like flipping out,
38:25
I'm like god. To be in that state where you can just bitch
38:31
and complain about just that. - It truly is the ultimate coping. You see that in a lot of the airport,
38:38
when people miss their flight, they need to get it rebooked, and it like, yo dude, this airport worker
38:43
is not like United corporate. This is not Continental Airlines corporate.
38:49
And this person's like, almost like in Star Wars, you have the storm troopers and it's okay to kill all the storm troopers 'cause they kinda look like a robot,
38:56
so people start to think that an employee of a corporation is like a robot or one of these terrorists like they'll blow up the Boston Marathon,
39:03
the Americans, and there's so much in coping that they just view that as like not even a person,
39:09
and so it takes a minute-- - Actually even with the Uber driver, if you're in coping, you're in the Uber driver,
39:15
you even view that person as a person. - It's Uber. - If you actually thought, wait a minute, that's another human being, what might that person
39:23
be thinking or feeling right now, certainly there's a lot more connection. There's that human to human connection,
39:28
you'll be more inspired to just, hey, doing good, what about you? Versus, fuck this person.
39:33
It's all just (clicks tongue), it's just you alone. It's like there's another person. What if you were that person?
39:39
So on the practical side from now on what you're gonna do is go out and this challenge sounds so simple
39:46
but it'll change your fucking life. Every single day, start interacting with, say, three people you don't know.
39:52
Just three people you don't know, chat with them. You're at the grocery store, instead of say, yelling at the person bagging your groceries,
39:59
ask them, "Hey, how's you day going?" Just talk to three people in a way where you're just sharing
40:05
some good fucking emotions, and when you do, look at their reactions.
40:10
Put yourself in their shoes and look at their reactions, and ask yourself, what are they thinking, what are they feeling?
40:15
And one thing that helps massively is just look for tenseness and look in their eyes.
40:21
If they're kinda tensing, maybe looking to the side, like, eh, okay, maybe you should change something.
40:27
Or if they're too bored, like looseness, maybe you should change something. Okay, for example, if you start asking a question
40:34
at the seminar and I use this example 'cause I see it every weekend, and someone goes a little too long into their back story,
40:41
at first the crowd's like okay we're listening, and then after awhile they'll either cringe like okay,
40:46
shut up now, or just tune out. That's when you gotta shift things and let go of
40:52
being attached to finish whatever the fuck you're saying. Shift things and realize, whoa, I just made it about me.
40:57
Also bring some awareness to what you're saying and why you're saying it, what's your intention behind what you're saying?
41:03
Is it about you or is it to give? Is it, wait, I'm saying this to impress,
41:08
oh I'm saying this to reinforce the story of me. I'm saying this 'cause I just wanna hear myself talk.
41:15
Be aware, even when someone shares good news, ask yourself how can I relate this to me? Okay that's great news but you know how this applies to me,
41:22
versus, can you just let it be? - Notice the difference is one is a dopamine spike energy,
41:29
where you're in a low vibration state and you're trying to spike your dopamine by putting it on you, whereas if you're already in
41:38
like a peaceful, present state, you're not relying on those dopamine spikes, so you're less likely to do that.
41:44
That's a very, very, very subtle point, because we're describing these subjective experience
41:49
of making the shift and one is a low vibration state and then like make it about you to get a dopamine spike,
41:55
it's kinda like a little mini dirty high, don't shame yourself for it but just understand it, versus being in a present state and seeing what emerges
42:02
from you in a natural way. - Yeah, and it's learning how to meet your own needs and make yourself feel good on your own.
42:08
I used to call this, here's a great one, emotional masturbation. Where literally, best example, everyone who's in coping,
42:17
it's like they wanna cum, and they can't masturbate, so they're literally walking around like,
42:23
can you jack me off right now, I really need to come. (laughs) Like, I really, really, can you do it?
42:29
Anyone, please, I really need to come. Please, please, please, trying to do anything to just cum.
42:34
They're walking around, you feel it, the neediness, like (groans), go. Once-- - So it's hand job solicitation.
42:40
- Literally. - Emotional hand job solicitation. - And then you're trying to figure out ways, well what if I say this, would they jack me off if I say that, what if I pretend to smile,
42:47
would they jack me off? You're just looking for someone to jack you off without realizing that hey, you can jack yourself off. - (laughing) That was beautiful, man.
42:54
- For real. It's like, you gotta realize, you can jack yourself off. - And by the way, it's not gay if it's for self-help.
43:01
So keep going. - Well no then instead of going up to someone like, will you jack me off, you're already jacking off, you're like, hey, join in on the fun,
43:08
and you just like jack each other off, and-- - I know I would do almost anything to make a video shocking.
43:14
I'm just tempted if we just now, but we're not gonna do it. Okay. - It's true, it's like, that's the difference in the vibe.
43:21
Is someone coming up to you and you feel the need like they need to be jacked off or that they're being jacked off.
43:26
(chuckles) - So do you wanna look like a guy that needs to jack off?
43:33
Or are you gonna be the guy that can jack himself off, and you gotta choose, and you gotta draw that line
43:38
and know who you are. - Oh and by the way, no, link into this too.
43:44
Another one is not taking things too fucking seriously. Taking things way too seriously, like someone hears like well wait a minute.
43:50
I don't know about this joke, it's not very appropriate, or well get back to talking seriously, what's this laughing?
43:55
Why are you wasting my time, me watching you laugh in this video? - Sign of coping, they don't like jokes in the video.
44:01
'Cause it's like, what is this fucking jack off thing, man? I'm struggling. It's almost like you went up to a homeless person
44:06
and you're about to give him a dollar, and then you're like, do you wanna hear about my little joke, before you get the buck?
44:12
And they're like, give me the fucking buck! and you're like, come on, let's do it guys, let's look at the fire and look at downtown
44:20
before you get the buck. And he's like just give me the fucking buck, I need a drink.
44:26
And you're like yeah, (mumbles) come on, yeah. And it's just like what the fuck?
44:32
So that's why we do a lot of jokes in videos is we're actually trying to give you a bit of a shift in perspective, we're actually trying to demonstrate,
44:39
just clowning around our humor is our fucking fucked up like west coast Hollywood humor. You always wanna ask yourself am I operating value,
44:47
good emotions, or am I being responsive to the situation? So like the example that you gave there
44:52
with the grocery clerk, in coping, you're probably staring at your fucking phone. Huge sign of coping, just stare at your phone.
44:58
I do it too, man, okay. Everybody in the whole room's gonna go quiet right now,
45:03
the room's like (chuckles nervously). But like if I'm being real, yeah.
45:09
If I'm fucking hungry as shit waiting at the restaurant, I'm going like, just kind of waiting for
45:15
the minutes to go by. If I'm having a great time, I'm less likely to be inclined to do that, so if you're staring at your phone,
45:22
being in this kind of like suppressed state, you're not thinking what does the situation need, right, so when the waiter comes,
45:28
when you're in a coping state, you're gonna stare at your phone, you're gonna mumble your order and not make them laugh and not make them have fun.
45:34
In a thriving state, you're gonna probably be coming from a frame of like the waiter's here.
45:39
This is a difficult job as that brussel sprouts guy showed us, right, he's scrambling all over.
45:45
And how can I share and shed some good energy into the situation? Now whenever I'm in a situation where,
45:52
say I'm at valet parking, and say I'm gonna give a guy a tip or something like that, the way that I tend to be is that I wanna feel
45:58
that that guy, even in valet parking, is feeling really, really good.
46:04
I'm gonna make him laugh a little bit. I'm gonna make the clerk laugh. Sometimes like one of the kinda funny things I love to do
46:10
is with an old lady, like if she's enjoying it and consenting and happy about the whole thing,
46:16
is I'll start flirting with her, really nasty and stuff like that, and a lot of time, they're like, oh thank, I'm like, oh yeah.
46:21
Just like, this 80 year old woman right. And at the end they're just like, "Thank you.
46:27
"Thank you, oh that was amazing." Just anything that you can do to lighten people's day, but what's funny is as the energy is always moving,
46:35
you're drawing up more energy and you're sharing more energy, so the basic frame is how to offer value,
46:42
good emotions over your response to situations. Let's bring it back to your seminar example, right.
46:47
One guy puts his hands up. You're in New York City in Manhattan and he says, "I came here from Iowa and I live on a farm,
46:56
"and the neighbor 10 miles down, I wanna fuck her "behind the haystack, so I thought I would ask.
47:04
"I thought the 600 people here could benefit "from you talking for half an hour about sex and dating
47:12
"with a cow and a haystack, a female cow." And you could give the half hour answer,
47:18
but there's two problems, first, it's gonna suck the energy out of the room. Unless it's hella funny would could be,
47:24
but in addition to that, he's now being trained that when you don't take mind of the energy of the room
47:35
and then you make it about you, you're gonna be rewarded, and so there's an instinct as a teacher where you're like,
47:41
I will sit here for hours with you answering whatever you want, I will do anything to help you,
47:47
but if I do this, it's like a kid acting up, and then you give a bunch of cookies for acting up,
47:52
you're not helping him, so you're almost always gonna go back to that same challenge of explaining to them this basic thing of you gotta offer value,
47:58
good emotions or what the situation is, so what would be a great example is a question, if you got 500 people there, a question that everybody,
48:06
like let's take a pause, so let's do some genius shit here, let's take a pause.
48:12
A, does the question benefit the whole group? B-- - Can the whole group hear me?
48:18
Am I smiling, or is it, so my question is this, blah. - Yeah like freaking out the room essentially, right?
48:24
- Yeah it's like loud enough so they all hear you, smiling like adding the good emotions versus taking those emotions away.
48:30
- If that guy has a question that made the room laugh, awesome. if the guy asks a question that the room could all
48:35
benefit from, awesome. Study what other people want to experience. Study it.
48:41
Study other people. What emotional state is that person addicted to? What is that person's ego and self-image like?
48:48
What are they trying to get out of the situation? Where are they going, what are their priorities, what is their existing world view,
48:55
what emotions do they wanna experience? What do they wanna experience from a person and how can I be myself and maintain my own
49:01
personal boundaries and authenticity but find a win-win to where I can share that with them
49:07
and we experience it together and really just coming from a basic frame that I got what I need, 'cause when I see celebrities out,
49:13
I remember I saw Vince Vaughn out. He just walks up like everybody in the room loves him, he's just like, "Good to meet you, friend."
49:18
He walks up to me. "Good to meet you, friend." Not an ounce of neediness coming from the guy, 'cause he has what he needs, but in doing so,
49:24
he just further solidifies his own god-like status. And that's really what we're trying to show you here is how to solidify that fucking god-like status
49:31
where you're just the fucking shit. You're the shit, because you got what you needed, everybody wants to be friends with you,
49:36
'cause you always bring that great energy. - So start now. Are you laughing or are you in your head?
49:41
Are you still wondering how does this all relate to me? Or can you perhaps smile?
49:47
Perhaps enjoy the fun that was shared. The message underneath the words.
49:53
- That was fucking amazing. - This was huge for me, this was so, so important.
49:58
- This gave me by far the greatest confidence I've ever had.
50:03
- We got really deep and I found some issues within myself. - One of the better things (mumbles) for my life. - He's made me realize so many things
50:11
that I have been suppressing for my entire life. - This here, if you remember this and you take it with you,
50:17
like that's what you need. You can't bullshit your subconscious. Until you fully accept and release and go through
50:25
and experience all the stuff you've suppressed, you're always gonna be escaping.
50:30
When the fuck do we actually sit down, really get in touch with what's going on, and then like experience it?
50:35
Where else are you gonna let loose like this? Where else? And where else are there gonna be other people who push you to let loose even more?
50:42
Nowhere. Everything outside the crew is telling you to do to opposite. As soon as you leave this room, you're back in society,
50:49
back in the place where people tell you to shut the fuck up. They tell you everything that's wrong about you, they tell you to fit in.
50:55
I don't care what is authentic in you, just keep it to yourself. You don't deserve it. Don't be happier than everyone else.
51:02
Fit in. (screaming) Now talk.
51:07
(yelling)
51:19
(crowd applauding) - This is the type of place that shows you what's possible.
51:29
(crowd chanting indistinctly)
