Great question. Here's what the **forward execution** phase would look like after Claude sets the goal and backward-designs the plan:

---

## üß© Forward Execution Phases

### 1. **Goal Confirmation**

Claude begins by restating the meta‚Äëprimitive you're aiming to reveal.

> e.g., ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre targeting a new semantic primitive around ‚Äòagency reversal‚Äô‚Äîa hidden operator in sentences that flips subject/object roles.‚Äù

---

### 2. **Plan Deployment**

Claude outlines an actionable sequence, derived from its backwards design:

1. **Collect candidate sentences** that likely embed the targeted primitive.
    
2. **Parse each sentence** to an interim representation (e.g., logical form).
    
3. **Analyze structural commonalities** to surface candidate primitives.
    
4. **Hypothesize a primitive** (naming it, defining its operator, type, compositional rules).
    
5. **Test** the hypothesis on held-out examples.
    
6. **Reflect and mutate**: assess novelty and coverage; if insufficient, iterate.

### 3. **Interactive Iterations**

At each stage, Claude takes initiative:

- **After gathering examples**, it asks:
    
    > ‚ÄúDo these 5 sentences look plausible for hiding the ‚Äòagency-reversal‚Äô operator?‚Äù
    
- **After initial parse-analysis**, it proposes a candidate primitive:
    
    > ‚ÄúI see recurring shift patterns: X contradicts Y. I define `AG_REV(subj, obj)` ‚Üí object initiated action. How does that feel?‚Äù
    
- **Post-testing**, it reports metrics: coverage, ambiguity resolution, elegance.
    
    > ‚ÄúCovers 80% of examples, but `Time flies like an arrow` fails. Should we refine operator or add a modifier?‚Äù
    

---

### 4. **Self-Reflection & Mutation**

Claude then actively evolves:

- Uses chain‚Äëof‚Äëthought to explain why the primitive works or where it fails.
    
- Suggests refined definitions or new test sentences.
    
- If the primitive seems stale, it may propose sibling primitives (e.g., `AG_REV`, `AG_INV`, `AG_PROX`), then ask you which to pursue.
    

---

### 5. **Final Synthesis**

Upon reaching a stable primitive:

- Claude summarizes the full semantic operator:
    
    - **Name** (e.g., `AG_REV`)
        
    - **Signature** (types, input‚Üíoutput)
        
    - **Composition rules** (how it interacts in complex sentences)
        
- Provides structured derivations:  
    e.g., `AG_REV(Alice, Bob) ‚áí ‚ÄúBob is acted upon by Alice.‚Äù`
    
- Suggests next-step scaffolding for integration into a larger calculus.
    

---

## ‚úÖ Summary:

**Forward execution** is a dynamic loop of:

1. Plan deployment,
    
2. Mixed-initiative examples and parsing,
    
3. Candidate primitive hypothesis,
    
4. Testing & meta‚Äëreflection,
    
5. Refinement loops.
    

This loop ends only when:

- The embedded primitive is _clarified, novel, and compositional_,
    
- Or a meta‚Äëdesign dead-end is discovered, prompting a shift.
    

Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to simulate an initial forward pass‚Äîstarting with a sample target or corpus!
